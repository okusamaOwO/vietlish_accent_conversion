DUMMY/p227/p227_388.wav|p227|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY/p243/p243_089.wav|p243|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY/p245/p245_115.wav|p245|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY/p248/p248_039.wav|p248|It was clear.
DUMMY/p245/p245_187.wav|p245|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p234/p234_055.wav|p234|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
DUMMY/p241/p241_347.wav|p241|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY/p247/p247_028.wav|p247|Because we do not need it.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_190.wav|p227|This is the time to use it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_077.wav|p246|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p228/p228_183.wav|p228|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p238/p238_327.wav|p238|Little is known about them.
DUMMY/p236/p236_186.wav|p236|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY/p230/p230_166.wav|p230|We believe in the medium term.
DUMMY/p236/p236_040.wav|p236|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY/p245/p245_251.wav|p245|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY/p238/p238_204.wav|p238|How independent is that ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_305.wav|p225|Cast Away now on general release.
DUMMY/p241/p241_369.wav|p241|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY/p249/p249_098.wav|p249|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_081.wav|p246|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY/p236/p236_341.wav|p236|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY/p238/p238_328.wav|p238|Margins are also in retreat.
DUMMY/p226/p226_095.wav|p226|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY/p232/p232_280.wav|p232|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY/p249/p249_084.wav|p249|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY/p226/p226_047.wav|p226|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p236/p236_295.wav|p236|And that match was played in June.
DUMMY/p249/p249_079.wav|p249|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p231/p231_295.wav|p231|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p240/p240_011.wav|p240|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_096.wav|p243|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
DUMMY/p240/p240_289.wav|p240|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY/p234/p234_350.wav|p234|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY/p231/p231_437.wav|p231|The growth potential is enormous.
DUMMY/p238/p238_072.wav|p238|I had relied on him.
DUMMY/p239/p239_312.wav|p239|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_300.wav|p229|I was brought up in a mining background.
DUMMY/p232/p232_347.wav|p232|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY/p249/p249_081.wav|p249|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY/p234/p234_103.wav|p234|Police said the family was helping with the search.
DUMMY/p231/p231_214.wav|p231|He also presented You Bet!
DUMMY/p229/p229_363.wav|p229|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY/p238/p238_366.wav|p238|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY/p239/p239_295.wav|p239|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY/p231/p231_426.wav|p231|My aim is a top six finish.
DUMMY/p240/p240_228.wav|p240|It is a gamble.
DUMMY/p243/p243_372.wav|p243|He really played us into a corner.
DUMMY/p237/p237_337.wav|p237|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY/p234/p234_057.wav|p234|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
DUMMY/p229/p229_234.wav|p229|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p229/p229_388.wav|p229|It has been a lovely family occasion.
DUMMY/p247/p247_033.wav|p247|It carried a double message.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_359.wav|p231|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY/p230/p230_383.wav|p230|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
DUMMY/p249/p249_313.wav|p249|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY/p249/p249_259.wav|p249|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY/p247/p247_252.wav|p247|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_334.wav|p248|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY/p234/p234_025.wav|p234|We are a service industry.
DUMMY/p244/p244_237.wav|p244|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p237/p237_034.wav|p237|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
DUMMY/p240/p240_187.wav|p240|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY/p229/p229_029.wav|p229|I have a theory.
DUMMY/p244/p244_177.wav|p244|They have not been named.
DUMMY/p236/p236_468.wav|p236|The bill would be massive.
DUMMY/p232/p232_115.wav|p232|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY/p239/p239_088.wav|p239|So what happens next ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_072.wav|p245|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY/p230/p230_220.wav|p230|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY/p236/p236_069.wav|p236|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p240/p240_140.wav|p240|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY/p237/p237_273.wav|p237|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p241/p241_002.wav|p241|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p229/p229_336.wav|p229|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY/p231/p231_362.wav|p231|You did not see it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_031.wav|p236|He was jailed for four years.
DUMMY/p232/p232_396.wav|p232|I can lead by example.
DUMMY/p229/p229_200.wav|p229|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY/p231/p231_337.wav|p231|The airport was even different.
DUMMY/p231/p231_471.wav|p231|Dennis was not so sure.
DUMMY/p246/p246_271.wav|p246|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY/p247/p247_187.wav|p247|I'm just going to hit the shot.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_306.wav|p229|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY/p237/p237_346.wav|p237|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p230/p230_310.wav|p230|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p246/p246_152.wav|p246|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY/p244/p244_415.wav|p244|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY/p229/p229_357.wav|p229|Tell us about it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_375.wav|p238|And he goes with it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_278.wav|p246|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_331.wav|p228|He has to learn.
DUMMY/p227/p227_121.wav|p227|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_338.wav|p238|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
DUMMY/p249/p249_253.wav|p249|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY/p232/p232_114.wav|p232|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY/p246/p246_108.wav|p246|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY/p239/p239_374.wav|p239|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY/p243/p243_059.wav|p243|We just want this season to end.
DUMMY/p249/p249_296.wav|p249|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY/p247/p247_474.wav|p247|They were impressive against France.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_225.wav|p236|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY/p231/p231_124.wav|p231|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY/p248/p248_030.wav|p248|I have a theory.
DUMMY/p249/p249_170.wav|p249|I'm so worried about the roads.
DUMMY/p249/p249_184.wav|p249|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p239/p239_390.wav|p239|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_031.wav|p249|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY/p236/p236_195.wav|p236|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY/p230/p230_068.wav|p230|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_191.wav|p231|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY/p244/p244_042.wav|p244|And they had a case.
DUMMY/p237/p237_067.wav|p237|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY/p244/p244_310.wav|p244|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
DUMMY/p230/p230_175.wav|p230|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY/p247/p247_011.wav|p247|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
DUMMY/p243/p243_128.wav|p243|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY/p238/p238_140.wav|p238|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY/p236/p236_095.wav|p236|I had a ball today.
DUMMY/p232/p232_361.wav|p232|I kept going for her.
DUMMY/p238/p238_406.wav|p238|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY/p239/p239_425.wav|p239|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY/p249/p249_205.wav|p249|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY/p245/p245_126.wav|p245|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY/p225/p225_276.wav|p225|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
DUMMY/p234/p234_174.wav|p234|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY/p245/p245_191.wav|p245|It's like a garage.
DUMMY/p237/p237_237.wav|p237|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY/p227/p227_187.wav|p227|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY/p238/p238_063.wav|p238|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY/p227/p227_305.wav|p227|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p236/p236_315.wav|p236|And we can do it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_094.wav|p239|But I had never been in a theatre.
DUMMY/p249/p249_157.wav|p249|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p249/p249_327.wav|p249|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p246/p246_141.wav|p246|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY/p229/p229_310.wav|p229|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p226/p226_055.wav|p226|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY/p239/p239_174.wav|p239|As if that is an achievement.
DUMMY/p234/p234_263.wav|p234|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY/p226/p226_049.wav|p226|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p229/p229_261.wav|p229|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY/p241/p241_271.wav|p241|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY/p240/p240_226.wav|p240|What was the main difference?
DUMMY/p228/p228_370.wav|p228|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY/p227/p227_122.wav|p227|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_072.wav|p229|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY/p238/p238_174.wav|p238|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
DUMMY/p236/p236_010.wav|p236|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p232/p232_351.wav|p232|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY/p246/p246_065.wav|p246|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY/p236/p236_204.wav|p236|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY/p239/p239_061.wav|p239|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
DUMMY/p245/p245_238.wav|p245|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY/p246/p246_320.wav|p246|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_058.wav|p240|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY/p247/p247_287.wav|p247|There's not much money in cycling.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_298.wav|p245|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY/p239/p239_143.wav|p239|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
DUMMY/p226/p226_190.wav|p226|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY/p228/p228_227.wav|p228|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY/p246/p246_229.wav|p246|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY/p249/p249_181.wav|p249|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY/p240/p240_258.wav|p240|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY/p239/p239_408.wav|p239|It seems a waste of talents.
DUMMY/p245/p245_325.wav|p245|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY/p231/p231_435.wav|p231|I never won a penny throughout my career.
DUMMY/p247/p247_434.wav|p247|No-one wanted to run it tonight.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_129.wav|p243|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
DUMMY/p246/p246_354.wav|p246|That would help.
DUMMY/p239/p239_434.wav|p239|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
DUMMY/p244/p244_118.wav|p244|Otherwise, the market may come back.
DUMMY/p243/p243_080.wav|p243|They said our costs were too high.
DUMMY/p246/p246_114.wav|p246|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY/p247/p247_426.wav|p247|Being captain of this club is fantastic.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_215.wav|p230|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
DUMMY/p238/p238_377.wav|p238|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY/p234/p234_112.wav|p234|That would be a serious problem.
DUMMY/p231/p231_086.wav|p231|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
DUMMY/p249/p249_273.wav|p249|Things can change.
DUMMY/p231/p231_367.wav|p231|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY/p240/p240_066.wav|p240|They are real.
DUMMY/p227/p227_366.wav|p227|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_027.wav|p241|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY/p246/p246_094.wav|p246|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_326.wav|p239|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY/p244/p244_347.wav|p244|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY/p229/p229_293.wav|p229|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p236/p236_145.wav|p236|We will provide immediate access.
DUMMY/p230/p230_384.wav|p230|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY/p243/p243_034.wav|p243|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
DUMMY/p239/p239_084.wav|p239|And it had two seats.
DUMMY/p232/p232_071.wav|p232|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p228/p228_155.wav|p228|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY/p239/p239_223.wav|p239|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
DUMMY/p228/p228_215.wav|p228|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY/p241/p241_280.wav|p241|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY/p234/p234_303.wav|p234|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_352.wav|p239|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
DUMMY/p232/p232_046.wav|p232|The judge said.
DUMMY/p236/p236_213.wav|p236|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY/p226/p226_180.wav|p226|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p231/p231_424.wav|p231|The road was closed for several hours.
DUMMY/p244/p244_190.wav|p244|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY/p245/p245_357.wav|p245|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p225/p225_253.wav|p225|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY/p246/p246_238.wav|p246|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY/p247/p247_118.wav|p247|The website has changed the company.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_369.wav|p229|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY/p228/p228_028.wav|p228|There's a story, too.
DUMMY/p243/p243_070.wav|p243|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
DUMMY/p228/p228_167.wav|p228|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY/p228/p228_265.wav|p228|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p241/p241_303.wav|p241|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p237/p237_254.wav|p237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY/p248/p248_069.wav|p248|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY/p244/p244_172.wav|p244|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY/p248/p248_202.wav|p248|But she might be.
DUMMY/p244/p244_209.wav|p244|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_258.wav|p244|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p230/p230_137.wav|p230|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY/p237/p237_294.wav|p237|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p238/p238_102.wav|p238|It's very dangerous for markets.
DUMMY/p238/p238_117.wav|p238|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY/p239/p239_205.wav|p239|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY/p232/p232_402.wav|p232|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_343.wav|p247|Are they free ?)
DUMMY/p229/p229_177.wav|p229|It's that sort of night.
DUMMY/p230/p230_212.wav|p230|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY/p237/p237_063.wav|p237|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY/p237/p237_231.wav|p237|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY/p239/p239_351.wav|p239|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p240/p240_317.wav|p240|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY/p232/p232_009.wav|p232|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p232/p232_113.wav|p232|It's not fair.
DUMMY/p232/p232_136.wav|p232|They took a risk.
DUMMY/p243/p243_019.wav|p243|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p231/p231_116.wav|p231|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
DUMMY/p241/p241_210.wav|p241|He knows a lot.
DUMMY/p238/p238_049.wav|p238|It comes from reflection or thinking.
DUMMY/p239/p239_026.wav|p239|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY/p226/p226_136.wav|p226|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
DUMMY/p237/p237_016.wav|p237|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p234/p234_343.wav|p234|The market is the market.
DUMMY/p229/p229_258.wav|p229|Kirkwood was arrested.
DUMMY/p231/p231_348.wav|p231|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_065.wav|p226|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY/p245/p245_294.wav|p245|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p238/p238_452.wav|p238|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY/p231/p231_452.wav|p231|Its future is no longer in question.
DUMMY/p249/p249_075.wav|p249|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p232/p232_247.wav|p232|She is well balanced.
DUMMY/p229/p229_266.wav|p229|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY/p236/p236_122.wav|p236|Becoming a father was wonderful.
DUMMY/p238/p238_439.wav|p238|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p240/p240_308.wav|p240|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY/p239/p239_064.wav|p239|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY/p241/p241_363.wav|p241|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY/p246/p246_093.wav|p246|It is home-grown.
DUMMY/p244/p244_315.wav|p244|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY/p244/p244_003.wav|p244|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p249/p249_303.wav|p249|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
DUMMY/p245/p245_324.wav|p245|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY/p245/p245_208.wav|p245|He demanded to speak to the boss.
DUMMY/p247/p247_114.wav|p247|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_023.wav|p225|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p225/p225_202.wav|p225|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
DUMMY/p246/p246_073.wav|p246|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY/p248/p248_066.wav|p248|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY/p234/p234_142.wav|p234|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY/p246/p246_160.wav|p246|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY/p227/p227_240.wav|p227|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY/p241/p241_072.wav|p241|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p243/p243_245.wav|p243|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_280.wav|p239|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY/p238/p238_189.wav|p238|This should begin in October.
DUMMY/p249/p249_141.wav|p249|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY/p238/p238_163.wav|p238|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY/p236/p236_201.wav|p236|It shows the strength of the roots.
DUMMY/p237/p237_062.wav|p237|None has ever been found.
DUMMY/p239/p239_444.wav|p239|Any error is severely punished.
DUMMY/p240/p240_257.wav|p240|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY/p227/p227_355.wav|p227|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
DUMMY/p246/p246_193.wav|p246|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY/p237/p237_007.wav|p237|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p229/p229_278.wav|p229|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY/p229/p229_131.wav|p229|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
DUMMY/p232/p232_065.wav|p232|He was popular.
DUMMY/p232/p232_244.wav|p232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY/p244/p244_149.wav|p244|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY/p243/p243_192.wav|p243|I am fighting the force of nature.
DUMMY/p232/p232_036.wav|p232|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY/p239/p239_194.wav|p239|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
DUMMY/p245/p245_310.wav|p245|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
DUMMY/p231/p231_438.wav|p231|They are not left wing.
DUMMY/p234/p234_081.wav|p234|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY/p239/p239_254.wav|p239|She replied, It could be.
DUMMY/p247/p247_471.wav|p247|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_240.wav|p243|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_059.wav|p248|It will take time.
DUMMY/p227/p227_310.wav|p227|We are not increasing the number.
DUMMY/p247/p247_284.wav|p247|These figures are truly terrible.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_027.wav|p229|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY/p239/p239_081.wav|p239|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY/p231/p231_127.wav|p231|This should begin in October.
DUMMY/p238/p238_073.wav|p238|And then there's the racial hassle.
DUMMY/p244/p244_399.wav|p244|I want this one to be different.
DUMMY/p237/p237_293.wav|p237|People have no choice.
DUMMY/p234/p234_355.wav|p234|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY/p230/p230_053.wav|p230|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p244/p244_196.wav|p244|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_111.wav|p247|Our house was very small.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_184.wav|p245|They are in the euro.
DUMMY/p244/p244_165.wav|p244|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY/p247/p247_071.wav|p247|Final proposals will be published in February.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_226.wav|p243|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p236/p236_432.wav|p236|Paris is not only young.
DUMMY/p238/p238_413.wav|p238|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY/p229/p229_043.wav|p229|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY/p234/p234_105.wav|p234|He has become a monster.
DUMMY/p226/p226_086.wav|p226|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY/p248/p248_182.wav|p248|I've been there.
DUMMY/p236/p236_125.wav|p236|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY/p237/p237_128.wav|p237|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY/p232/p232_334.wav|p232|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY/p245/p245_038.wav|p245|It has failed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_080.wav|p227|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY/p225/p225_135.wav|p225|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY/p232/p232_303.wav|p232|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY/p246/p246_233.wav|p246|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY/p239/p239_420.wav|p239|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p240/p240_032.wav|p240|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p239/p239_370.wav|p239|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY/p239/p239_273.wav|p239|I thought we were fantastic.
DUMMY/p236/p236_398.wav|p236|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_294.wav|p234|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY/p241/p241_012.wav|p241|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p241/p241_108.wav|p241|Is that right?
DUMMY/p247/p247_286.wav|p247|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_070.wav|p226|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY/p234/p234_224.wav|p234|The force is with them.
DUMMY/p244/p244_236.wav|p244|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY/p241/p241_190.wav|p241|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY/p245/p245_132.wav|p245|They did very well.
DUMMY/p238/p238_260.wav|p238|It's about time something was done about equipment.
DUMMY/p241/p241_265.wav|p241|It's very nice.
DUMMY/p231/p231_298.wav|p231|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY/p244/p244_373.wav|p244|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p237/p237_323.wav|p237|It should be equal.
DUMMY/p247/p247_311.wav|p247|The effect was almost magical.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_244.wav|p244|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_049.wav|p241|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY/p234/p234_066.wav|p234|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY/p234/p234_322.wav|p234|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY/p246/p246_078.wav|p246|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY/p249/p249_122.wav|p249|Does this mean.
DUMMY/p227/p227_078.wav|p227|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY/p240/p240_046.wav|p240|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p249/p249_294.wav|p249|A new school will be built.
DUMMY/p227/p227_218.wav|p227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY/p226/p226_019.wav|p226|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p238/p238_119.wav|p238|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_179.wav|p228|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY/p238/p238_108.wav|p238|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY/p243/p243_293.wav|p243|They first met during a Step in London.
DUMMY/p239/p239_058.wav|p239|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY/p247/p247_295.wav|p247|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_007.wav|p236|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p244/p244_054.wav|p244|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY/p247/p247_278.wav|p247|On the contrary they stand to gain.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_262.wav|p230|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY/p234/p234_299.wav|p234|We were well worth the win.
DUMMY/p231/p231_242.wav|p231|She took them for a term.
DUMMY/p231/p231_323.wav|p231|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY/p245/p245_197.wav|p245|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p238/p238_429.wav|p238|Not many people like to do that.
DUMMY/p231/p231_259.wav|p231|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_278.wav|p227|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY/p241/p241_329.wav|p241|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_159.wav|p237|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p236/p236_243.wav|p236|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY/p248/p248_068.wav|p248|It's good news and long overdue.
DUMMY/p231/p231_179.wav|p231|But one was not enough.
DUMMY/p239/p239_065.wav|p239|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY/p244/p244_110.wav|p244|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY/p238/p238_085.wav|p238|It is somewhere to be.
DUMMY/p240/p240_166.wav|p240|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p231/p231_045.wav|p231|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY/p247/p247_386.wav|p247|The pair are very much in love.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_151.wav|p246|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY/p228/p228_316.wav|p228|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p226/p226_314.wav|p226|I did not name it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_149.wav|p231|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p231/p231_402.wav|p231|It is a large number.
DUMMY/p249/p249_321.wav|p249|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p228/p228_094.wav|p228|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY/p229/p229_158.wav|p229|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p240/p240_007.wav|p240|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p247/p247_032.wav|p247|It is not for any other purpose.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_344.wav|p232|He has to learn.
DUMMY/p243/p243_254.wav|p243|I'd rather play well next week than here.
DUMMY/p227/p227_081.wav|p227|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p231/p231_065.wav|p231|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_199.wav|p249|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY/p228/p228_198.wav|p228|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY/p244/p244_101.wav|p244|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY/p232/p232_202.wav|p232|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY/p225/p225_158.wav|p225|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p240/p240_005.wav|p240|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p238/p238_067.wav|p238|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY/p226/p226_210.wav|p226|It's like a garage.
DUMMY/p229/p229_202.wav|p229|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_407.wav|p247|There was an element of frustration.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_331.wav|p237|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p241/p241_324.wav|p241|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p234/p234_225.wav|p234|Her experience is certainly limited.
DUMMY/p238/p238_099.wav|p238|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p229/p229_123.wav|p229|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY/p226/p226_317.wav|p226|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY/p245/p245_192.wav|p245|We don't even know his name.
DUMMY/p243/p243_079.wav|p243|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
DUMMY/p241/p241_116.wav|p241|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY/p239/p239_266.wav|p239|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY/p249/p249_188.wav|p249|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
DUMMY/p247/p247_059.wav|p247|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY/p236/p236_503.wav|p236|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
DUMMY/p245/p245_341.wav|p245|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
DUMMY/p243/p243_238.wav|p243|The children were later able to leave by bus.
DUMMY/p234/p234_180.wav|p234|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY/p247/p247_334.wav|p247|And he goes with it.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_343.wav|p238|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
DUMMY/p232/p232_183.wav|p232|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY/p236/p236_178.wav|p236|So what happens next ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_330.wav|p236|I didn't have the reply.
DUMMY/p238/p238_305.wav|p238|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY/p244/p244_385.wav|p244|Everything is in the mix.
DUMMY/p240/p240_274.wav|p240|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY/p232/p232_216.wav|p232|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY/p232/p232_307.wav|p232|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY/p227/p227_370.wav|p227|We need to be prepared.
DUMMY/p232/p232_205.wav|p232|It's a mixture of everything.
DUMMY/p241/p241_024.wav|p241|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_030.wav|p237|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY/p236/p236_253.wav|p236|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY/p232/p232_376.wav|p232|He could make it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_130.wav|p236|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY/p248/p248_077.wav|p248|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY/p248/p248_247.wav|p248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY/p245/p245_239.wav|p245|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY/p248/p248_299.wav|p248|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY/p230/p230_019.wav|p230|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p243/p243_030.wav|p243|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY/p240/p240_344.wav|p240|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p240/p240_108.wav|p240|It's a shame.
DUMMY/p226/p226_357.wav|p226|I kept going for her.
DUMMY/p232/p232_225.wav|p232|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY/p240/p240_335.wav|p240|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY/p248/p248_118.wav|p248|But the fans deserve to know!
DUMMY/p247/p247_144.wav|p247|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_402.wav|p244|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY/p237/p237_202.wav|p237|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY/p245/p245_113.wav|p245|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY/p243/p243_272.wav|p243|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
DUMMY/p244/p244_081.wav|p244|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_445.wav|p238|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
DUMMY/p248/p248_119.wav|p248|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p232/p232_228.wav|p232|It was good fun.
DUMMY/p239/p239_200.wav|p239|It's been a humbling year.
DUMMY/p226/p226_110.wav|p226|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p229/p229_206.wav|p229|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY/p230/p230_207.wav|p230|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY/p247/p247_070.wav|p247|It's not covered by the insurance.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_319.wav|p232|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY/p237/p237_302.wav|p237|He should have won.
DUMMY/p244/p244_146.wav|p244|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY/p225/p225_295.wav|p225|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY/p239/p239_144.wav|p239|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY/p231/p231_160.wav|p231|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_091.wav|p248|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY/p241/p241_176.wav|p241|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY/p240/p240_054.wav|p240|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p228/p228_163.wav|p228|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY/p246/p246_187.wav|p246|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
DUMMY/p231/p231_449.wav|p231|And we might go back.
DUMMY/p236/p236_153.wav|p236|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY/p238/p238_100.wav|p238|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p227/p227_204.wav|p227|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY/p226/p226_225.wav|p226|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p234/p234_330.wav|p234|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY/p241/p241_195.wav|p241|It's the same old story.
DUMMY/p227/p227_052.wav|p227|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY/p236/p236_015.wav|p236|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p243/p243_241.wav|p243|Why change it ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_335.wav|p249|I must make that clear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_469.wav|p236|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY/p229/p229_024.wav|p229|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p240/p240_297.wav|p240|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY/p248/p248_275.wav|p248|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY/p241/p241_246.wav|p241|They are different types.
DUMMY/p247/p247_361.wav|p247|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_067.wav|p225|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY/p232/p232_309.wav|p232|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY/p236/p236_364.wav|p236|She said they would appeal.
DUMMY/p234/p234_332.wav|p234|But it can be done.
DUMMY/p234/p234_030.wav|p234|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY/p232/p232_265.wav|p232|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY/p226/p226_007.wav|p226|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p246/p246_113.wav|p246|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY/p232/p232_024.wav|p232|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_029.wav|p237|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY/p247/p247_019.wav|p247|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
DUMMY/p240/p240_215.wav|p240|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY/p231/p231_289.wav|p231|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY/p244/p244_055.wav|p244|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY/p245/p245_314.wav|p245|For the moment, our position remains the same.
DUMMY/p248/p248_315.wav|p248|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY/p225/p225_064.wav|p225|It could take some time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_325.wav|p243|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
DUMMY/p246/p246_216.wav|p246|Because they didn't want to know.
DUMMY/p246/p246_101.wav|p246|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_264.wav|p227|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY/p245/p245_133.wav|p245|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY/p248/p248_346.wav|p248|Tyson is overwhelmed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_175.wav|p231|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p227/p227_155.wav|p227|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY/p240/p240_298.wav|p240|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY/p246/p246_016.wav|p246|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p244/p244_256.wav|p244|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY/p248/p248_231.wav|p248|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY/p229/p229_085.wav|p229|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p240/p240_072.wav|p240|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY/p248/p248_322.wav|p248|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p230/p230_108.wav|p230|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY/p228/p228_137.wav|p228|Who will attend ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_119.wav|p245|Who will attend?
DUMMY/p227/p227_334.wav|p227|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_100.wav|p237|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY/p241/p241_307.wav|p241|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY/p244/p244_029.wav|p244|It is about investing in the future.
DUMMY/p239/p239_388.wav|p239|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY/p239/p239_218.wav|p239|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p230/p230_349.wav|p230|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p241/p241_145.wav|p241|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY/p241/p241_276.wav|p241|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY/p236/p236_390.wav|p236|She is in their hands.
DUMMY/p240/p240_120.wav|p240|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p239/p239_068.wav|p239|I'm pleased with the horse.
DUMMY/p236/p236_002.wav|p236|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p227/p227_174.wav|p227|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY/p226/p226_221.wav|p226|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY/p246/p246_352.wav|p246|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY/p247/p247_069.wav|p247|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_500.wav|p236|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
DUMMY/p228/p228_279.wav|p228|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p249/p249_338.wav|p249|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p236/p236_263.wav|p236|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY/p234/p234_221.wav|p234|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY/p228/p228_070.wav|p228|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY/p246/p246_197.wav|p246|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY/p240/p240_328.wav|p240|They had a confession.
DUMMY/p230/p230_338.wav|p230|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY/p232/p232_037.wav|p232|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY/p247/p247_219.wav|p247|Is it in the right place ?)
DUMMY/p226/p226_188.wav|p226|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY/p236/p236_377.wav|p236|I understand the frustration of the fans.
DUMMY/p238/p238_114.wav|p238|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
DUMMY/p238/p238_216.wav|p238|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY/p239/p239_478.wav|p239|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY/p244/p244_353.wav|p244|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
DUMMY/p229/p229_253.wav|p229|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
DUMMY/p248/p248_092.wav|p248|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY/p249/p249_046.wav|p249|As she explains.
DUMMY/p229/p229_014.wav|p229|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p243/p243_181.wav|p243|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
DUMMY/p239/p239_292.wav|p239|They will probably come back.
DUMMY/p246/p246_255.wav|p246|Is that a serious question?
DUMMY/p229/p229_252.wav|p229|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY/p231/p231_070.wav|p231|This is an exciting new venture.
DUMMY/p241/p241_356.wav|p241|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY/p237/p237_196.wav|p237|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY/p244/p244_094.wav|p244|It is not a story.
DUMMY/p249/p249_230.wav|p249|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
DUMMY/p227/p227_289.wav|p227|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
DUMMY/p228/p228_128.wav|p228|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p239/p239_022.wav|p239|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p244/p244_180.wav|p244|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY/p234/p234_092.wav|p234|They have a further report to make in March.
DUMMY/p226/p226_006.wav|p226|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p231/p231_233.wav|p231|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
DUMMY/p231/p231_422.wav|p231|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY/p234/p234_061.wav|p234|You have to be patient.
DUMMY/p227/p227_077.wav|p227|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY/p229/p229_356.wav|p229|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY/p231/p231_111.wav|p231|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY/p232/p232_160.wav|p232|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY/p225/p225_211.wav|p225|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
DUMMY/p238/p238_316.wav|p238|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY/p230/p230_279.wav|p230|There is a case to answer.
DUMMY/p244/p244_092.wav|p244|It sounds a lot of money.
DUMMY/p226/p226_268.wav|p226|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY/p232/p232_271.wav|p232|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY/p246/p246_027.wav|p246|Is this accurate?
DUMMY/p227/p227_378.wav|p227|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY/p236/p236_465.wav|p236|I was all image and no substance.
DUMMY/p236/p236_351.wav|p236|He had no previous convictions.
DUMMY/p248/p248_112.wav|p248|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY/p244/p244_245.wav|p244|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_133.wav|p244|Or it would have been.
DUMMY/p232/p232_087.wav|p232|No progress has been made.
DUMMY/p236/p236_429.wav|p236|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY/p237/p237_266.wav|p237|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY/p237/p237_104.wav|p237|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY/p234/p234_319.wav|p234|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY/p238/p238_387.wav|p238|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY/p229/p229_309.wav|p229|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY/p246/p246_136.wav|p246|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY/p246/p246_292.wav|p246|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY/p248/p248_135.wav|p248|Government will intervene.
DUMMY/p240/p240_259.wav|p240|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY/p225/p225_026.wav|p225|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_103.wav|p240|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY/p243/p243_304.wav|p243|Had I heard ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_270.wav|p240|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY/p225/p225_358.wav|p225|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY/p232/p232_227.wav|p232|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p241/p241_259.wav|p241|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY/p237/p237_316.wav|p237|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY/p229/p229_018.wav|p229|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p229/p229_175.wav|p229|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY/p244/p244_412.wav|p244|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
DUMMY/p246/p246_109.wav|p246|It was the eighties.
DUMMY/p232/p232_032.wav|p232|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY/p243/p243_384.wav|p243|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_365.wav|p244|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY/p239/p239_245.wav|p239|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_404.wav|p238|Everything has its place and purpose.
DUMMY/p229/p229_180.wav|p229|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY/p244/p244_070.wav|p244|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY/p241/p241_099.wav|p241|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY/p241/p241_112.wav|p241|The breakdown was much later in her life.
DUMMY/p245/p245_051.wav|p245|It's a blessing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_232.wav|p227|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY/p248/p248_235.wav|p248|I haven't made the donation yet.
DUMMY/p247/p247_404.wav|p247|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_010.wav|p239|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_250.wav|p241|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY/p228/p228_061.wav|p228|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p230/p230_316.wav|p230|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY/p225/p225_143.wav|p225|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
DUMMY/p238/p238_310.wav|p238|We are trying to clarify the issues.
DUMMY/p236/p236_357.wav|p236|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
DUMMY/p231/p231_355.wav|p231|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p234/p234_110.wav|p234|We are currently working on the details.
DUMMY/p231/p231_169.wav|p231|It is really good news.
DUMMY/p237/p237_095.wav|p237|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY/p238/p238_109.wav|p238|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
DUMMY/p240/p240_147.wav|p240|They did very well.
DUMMY/p241/p241_234.wav|p241|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY/p231/p231_276.wav|p231|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY/p243/p243_204.wav|p243|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
DUMMY/p225/p225_330.wav|p225|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p239/p239_110.wav|p239|I can't remember a lot of it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_296.wav|p248|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY/p226/p226_193.wav|p226|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY/p227/p227_069.wav|p227|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY/p236/p236_332.wav|p236|These days will be back.
DUMMY/p247/p247_080.wav|p247|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_048.wav|p249|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p229/p229_113.wav|p229|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY/p231/p231_008.wav|p231|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p238/p238_155.wav|p238|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY/p230/p230_112.wav|p230|We have the mental strength.
DUMMY/p230/p230_018.wav|p230|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p249/p249_026.wav|p249|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY/p236/p236_187.wav|p236|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p229/p229_245.wav|p229|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY/p229/p229_057.wav|p229|She's a spy !
DUMMY/p234/p234_062.wav|p234|That is all in the past.
DUMMY/p231/p231_046.wav|p231|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY/p229/p229_086.wav|p229|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY/p230/p230_353.wav|p230|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p234/p234_023.wav|p234|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_009.wav|p249|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p241/p241_323.wav|p241|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY/p226/p226_090.wav|p226|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY/p230/p230_258.wav|p230|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY/p247/p247_021.wav|p247|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
DUMMY/p245/p245_110.wav|p245|We work on the same level.
DUMMY/p236/p236_424.wav|p236|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
DUMMY/p247/p247_057.wav|p247|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
DUMMY/p226/p226_179.wav|p226|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY/p238/p238_261.wav|p238|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p230/p230_013.wav|p230|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p236/p236_133.wav|p236|She died at her home.
DUMMY/p226/p226_154.wav|p226|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY/p247/p247_039.wav|p247|It depends on the decisions of the member states.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_024.wav|p240|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p229/p229_091.wav|p229|We must look forward.
DUMMY/p239/p239_304.wav|p239|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY/p232/p232_035.wav|p232|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p248/p248_139.wav|p248|It was typical.
DUMMY/p238/p238_151.wav|p238|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_150.wav|p247|Was it the wife ?)
DUMMY/p237/p237_035.wav|p237|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY/p241/p241_102.wav|p241|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
DUMMY/p226/p226_327.wav|p226|We do the same.
DUMMY/p231/p231_376.wav|p231|We were given a break.
DUMMY/p241/p241_327.wav|p241|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY/p243/p243_133.wav|p243|No country has a similar training programme.
DUMMY/p248/p248_307.wav|p248|It should be equal.
DUMMY/p230/p230_328.wav|p230|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY/p230/p230_313.wav|p230|The casting is as perfect.
DUMMY/p241/p241_289.wav|p241|It changed my life.
DUMMY/p245/p245_036.wav|p245|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p230/p230_056.wav|p230|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p249/p249_074.wav|p249|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY/p225/p225_349.wav|p225|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_088.wav|p243|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
DUMMY/p240/p240_157.wav|p240|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY/p230/p230_149.wav|p230|However, he was later released without charge.
DUMMY/p240/p240_124.wav|p240|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY/p231/p231_082.wav|p231|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY/p236/p236_087.wav|p236|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_291.wav|p230|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY/p232/p232_386.wav|p232|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
DUMMY/p247/p247_086.wav|p247|It makes for an interesting conference.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_342.wav|p248|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY/p229/p229_121.wav|p229|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY/p245/p245_152.wav|p245|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p243/p243_056.wav|p243|They seem too much of a sure thing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_430.wav|p239|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY/p226/p226_178.wav|p226|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY/p239/p239_486.wav|p239|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY/p249/p249_149.wav|p249|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p229/p229_376.wav|p229|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY/p229/p229_312.wav|p229|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p234/p234_275.wav|p234|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY/p245/p245_045.wav|p245|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY/p230/p230_058.wav|p230|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY/p236/p236_294.wav|p236|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p229/p229_318.wav|p229|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY/p243/p243_355.wav|p243|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
DUMMY/p244/p244_228.wav|p244|We want this place to work.
DUMMY/p246/p246_083.wav|p246|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY/p237/p237_208.wav|p237|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p248/p248_172.wav|p248|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY/p227/p227_058.wav|p227|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_368.wav|p231|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
DUMMY/p248/p248_260.wav|p248|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p241/p241_252.wav|p241|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_272.wav|p239|A winter of discontent awaits.
DUMMY/p247/p247_117.wav|p247|You had better believe it.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_389.wav|p229|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY/p241/p241_030.wav|p241|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY/p239/p239_317.wav|p239|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_193.wav|p231|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY/p239/p239_062.wav|p239|Perhaps we should do the same.
DUMMY/p232/p232_254.wav|p232|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
DUMMY/p227/p227_235.wav|p227|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p247/p247_330.wav|p247|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_388.wav|p232|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY/p231/p231_307.wav|p231|You are a different people.
DUMMY/p247/p247_257.wav|p247|Kingfisher can afford to wait.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_428.wav|p236|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY/p240/p240_041.wav|p240|It was the eighties.
DUMMY/p228/p228_026.wav|p228|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY/p245/p245_002.wav|p245|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p228/p228_174.wav|p228|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY/p226/p226_346.wav|p226|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY/p247/p247_058.wav|p247|How are you, sir ?)
DUMMY/p239/p239_087.wav|p239|He has really done well.
DUMMY/p248/p248_216.wav|p248|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
DUMMY/p249/p249_208.wav|p249|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
DUMMY/p238/p238_318.wav|p238|Sadly, it does not end there.
DUMMY/p244/p244_036.wav|p244|This is a central issue.
DUMMY/p232/p232_144.wav|p232|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p234/p234_001.wav|p234|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p237/p237_003.wav|p237|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p229/p229_193.wav|p229|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_063.wav|p246|He could make it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_042.wav|p248|I was scared.
DUMMY/p249/p249_196.wav|p249|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY/p232/p232_394.wav|p232|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY/p247/p247_341.wav|p247|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_272.wav|p232|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY/p231/p231_122.wav|p231|We should not be surprised.
DUMMY/p249/p249_218.wav|p249|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY/p228/p228_197.wav|p228|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY/p241/p241_073.wav|p241|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p246/p246_328.wav|p246|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY/p248/p248_267.wav|p248|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p248/p248_097.wav|p248|I had a ball today.
DUMMY/p232/p232_392.wav|p232|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
DUMMY/p231/p231_230.wav|p231|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY/p234/p234_040.wav|p234|We are the party of the future.
DUMMY/p247/p247_001.wav|p247|Please call Stella.  )
DUMMY/p228/p228_365.wav|p228|So there, we won.
DUMMY/p241/p241_226.wav|p241|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY/p241/p241_241.wav|p241|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY/p240/p240_019.wav|p240|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p228/p228_191.wav|p228|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY/p231/p231_405.wav|p231|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY/p241/p241_153.wav|p241|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY/p227/p227_360.wav|p227|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY/p230/p230_203.wav|p230|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY/p243/p243_220.wav|p243|I was independent but I am not now.
DUMMY/p243/p243_395.wav|p243|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
DUMMY/p227/p227_163.wav|p227|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p225/p225_210.wav|p225|Scotland will play its part.
DUMMY/p245/p245_211.wav|p245|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY/p246/p246_144.wav|p246|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p227/p227_143.wav|p227|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY/p243/p243_029.wav|p243|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
DUMMY/p244/p244_243.wav|p244|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY/p239/p239_189.wav|p239|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
DUMMY/p230/p230_140.wav|p230|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY/p225/p225_153.wav|p225|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p227/p227_276.wav|p227|I told you I was ill.
DUMMY/p236/p236_138.wav|p236|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY/p230/p230_039.wav|p230|This will save interest charges.
DUMMY/p249/p249_309.wav|p249|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_221.wav|p240|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY/p247/p247_308.wav|p247|We would hope to make progress on that next year.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_095.wav|p238|It wasn't possible to relax.
DUMMY/p245/p245_253.wav|p245|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY/p240/p240_080.wav|p240|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY/p228/p228_262.wav|p228|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
DUMMY/p232/p232_079.wav|p232|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY/p225/p225_058.wav|p225|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_040.wav|p227|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY/p238/p238_378.wav|p238|It was really quite amazing.
DUMMY/p243/p243_045.wav|p243|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_095.wav|p228|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY/p230/p230_107.wav|p230|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY/p249/p249_059.wav|p249|It will take time.
DUMMY/p231/p231_095.wav|p231|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY/p236/p236_502.wav|p236|I stayed away from the defence.
DUMMY/p236/p236_459.wav|p236|Dennis was not so sure.
DUMMY/p236/p236_441.wav|p236|The damage is all inside.
DUMMY/p249/p249_345.wav|p249|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY/p236/p236_188.wav|p236|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY/p236/p236_168.wav|p236|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
DUMMY/p231/p231_129.wav|p231|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p246/p246_068.wav|p246|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p237/p237_252.wav|p237|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY/p237/p237_008.wav|p237|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p236/p236_190.wav|p236|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY/p245/p245_031.wav|p245|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY/p245/p245_037.wav|p245|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY/p231/p231_251.wav|p231|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p226/p226_279.wav|p226|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY/p226/p226_177.wav|p226|I took the gun.
DUMMY/p231/p231_382.wav|p231|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_155.wav|p229|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY/p247/p247_247.wav|p247|I am not going to go tomorrow.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_149.wav|p246|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p244/p244_292.wav|p244|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY/p228/p228_334.wav|p228|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY/p227/p227_082.wav|p227|We have to offer value for money.
DUMMY/p228/p228_058.wav|p228|That's the truth.
DUMMY/p247/p247_388.wav|p247|It benefits the whole family.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_081.wav|p230|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p243/p243_212.wav|p243|It is going to change the world.
DUMMY/p248/p248_345.wav|p248|I kept going for her.
DUMMY/p231/p231_186.wav|p231|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY/p246/p246_043.wav|p246|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
DUMMY/p238/p238_441.wav|p238|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_217.wav|p238|I will not take part in Edmonton.
DUMMY/p244/p244_267.wav|p244|But we were in control at that point.
DUMMY/p246/p246_336.wav|p246|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY/p240/p240_052.wav|p240|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
DUMMY/p238/p238_134.wav|p238|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY/p239/p239_066.wav|p239|Everything is possible in football.
DUMMY/p245/p245_161.wav|p245|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p243/p243_114.wav|p243|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_242.wav|p226|It's only fair.
DUMMY/p241/p241_170.wav|p241|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY/p227/p227_149.wav|p227|That was the difference between the sides.
DUMMY/p227/p227_032.wav|p227|There, you were just a body.
DUMMY/p238/p238_391.wav|p238|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY/p228/p228_129.wav|p228|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p244/p244_113.wav|p244|He is not a dancer.
DUMMY/p239/p239_494.wav|p239|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY/p239/p239_297.wav|p239|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY/p240/p240_234.wav|p240|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY/p241/p241_334.wav|p241|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
DUMMY/p232/p232_282.wav|p232|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY/p248/p248_229.wav|p248|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY/p248/p248_061.wav|p248|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY/p243/p243_299.wav|p243|He could understand both points of view.
DUMMY/p240/p240_197.wav|p240|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY/p231/p231_020.wav|p231|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_188.wav|p239|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY/p240/p240_209.wav|p240|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p236/p236_491.wav|p236|Our fans have been marvellous.
DUMMY/p240/p240_379.wav|p240|It's now down in black and white.
DUMMY/p231/p231_297.wav|p231|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p248/p248_279.wav|p248|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY/p231/p231_271.wav|p231|I thought he might have been a bit.
DUMMY/p227/p227_331.wav|p227|I'm not worried about the critics.
DUMMY/p240/p240_078.wav|p240|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY/p236/p236_094.wav|p236|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY/p240/p240_360.wav|p240|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY/p249/p249_183.wav|p249|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
DUMMY/p226/p226_034.wav|p226|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
DUMMY/p230/p230_268.wav|p230|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY/p227/p227_173.wav|p227|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY/p249/p249_223.wav|p249|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY/p230/p230_352.wav|p230|I have a moral dilemma.
DUMMY/p227/p227_139.wav|p227|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY/p238/p238_162.wav|p238|The milk industry is in turmoil.
DUMMY/p231/p231_418.wav|p231|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY/p239/p239_316.wav|p239|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_239.wav|p241|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY/p246/p246_019.wav|p246|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p226/p226_217.wav|p226|It's not ideal.
DUMMY/p246/p246_066.wav|p246|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY/p243/p243_252.wav|p243|The rise has come too late for some.
DUMMY/p241/p241_127.wav|p241|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY/p225/p225_060.wav|p225|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY/p249/p249_057.wav|p249|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY/p231/p231_038.wav|p231|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY/p243/p243_053.wav|p243|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
DUMMY/p241/p241_075.wav|p241|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p246/p246_040.wav|p246|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY/p244/p244_413.wav|p244|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p236/p236_101.wav|p236|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p239/p239_343.wav|p239|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p227/p227_300.wav|p227|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY/p232/p232_209.wav|p232|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY/p239/p239_106.wav|p239|He will be kept informed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_324.wav|p249|I am so upset.
DUMMY/p240/p240_069.wav|p240|It should be devolved.
DUMMY/p238/p238_430.wav|p238|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY/p237/p237_045.wav|p237|It is so sad.
DUMMY/p241/p241_028.wav|p241|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p231/p231_232.wav|p231|She died in middle age.
DUMMY/p245/p245_256.wav|p245|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY/p238/p238_133.wav|p238|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
DUMMY/p247/p247_113.wav|p247|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_128.wav|p232|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY/p247/p247_263.wav|p247|He has also cut a record.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_224.wav|p248|It was good fun.
DUMMY/p246/p246_012.wav|p246|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p245/p245_290.wav|p245|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY/p236/p236_071.wav|p236|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY/p241/p241_224.wav|p241|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY/p243/p243_297.wav|p243|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY/p229/p229_096.wav|p229|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY/p231/p231_341.wav|p231|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
DUMMY/p243/p243_004.wav|p243|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p240/p240_217.wav|p240|I was so nervous.
DUMMY/p240/p240_185.wav|p240|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_475.wav|p236|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY/p245/p245_049.wav|p245|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY/p237/p237_090.wav|p237|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY/p247/p247_244.wav|p247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_238.wav|p234|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY/p232/p232_098.wav|p232|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY/p241/p241_173.wav|p241|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p226/p226_163.wav|p226|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY/p228/p228_357.wav|p228|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY/p232/p232_411.wav|p232|You wanted the evidence.
DUMMY/p249/p249_190.wav|p249|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY/p238/p238_023.wav|p238|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p248/p248_057.wav|p248|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY/p239/p239_121.wav|p239|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY/p232/p232_308.wav|p232|We are in the end game.
DUMMY/p231/p231_406.wav|p231|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY/p240/p240_363.wav|p240|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY/p239/p239_298.wav|p239|We may need to take some very radical measures.
DUMMY/p236/p236_278.wav|p236|We have the moral high ground.
DUMMY/p234/p234_346.wav|p234|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY/p227/p227_086.wav|p227|This is a complex and detailed report.
DUMMY/p239/p239_134.wav|p239|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
DUMMY/p231/p231_005.wav|p231|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p227/p227_252.wav|p227|The irony was not lost.
DUMMY/p239/p239_471.wav|p239|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY/p230/p230_083.wav|p230|It might change your life.
DUMMY/p245/p245_099.wav|p245|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY/p226/p226_175.wav|p226|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p236/p236_285.wav|p236|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY/p238/p238_331.wav|p238|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY/p239/p239_271.wav|p239|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY/p243/p243_377.wav|p243|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
DUMMY/p237/p237_092.wav|p237|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p225/p225_117.wav|p225|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
DUMMY/p244/p244_302.wav|p244|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY/p236/p236_338.wav|p236|The game is now open.
DUMMY/p244/p244_096.wav|p244|He is in the US.
DUMMY/p227/p227_363.wav|p227|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY/p225/p225_179.wav|p225|They know no other way.
DUMMY/p232/p232_198.wav|p232|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY/p225/p225_114.wav|p225|I told him I was a long time ago.
DUMMY/p228/p228_186.wav|p228|We knew nothing about it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_326.wav|p228|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY/p238/p238_296.wav|p238|But there's an upturn in the sector.
DUMMY/p228/p228_019.wav|p228|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p244/p244_316.wav|p244|It involved the same people.
DUMMY/p247/p247_332.wav|p247|They come to enjoy themselves.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_181.wav|p244|I was always in control.
DUMMY/p247/p247_020.wav|p247|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
DUMMY/p239/p239_231.wav|p239|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY/p243/p243_018.wav|p243|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_050.wav|p241|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_108.wav|p228|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p234/p234_201.wav|p234|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY/p239/p239_157.wav|p239|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p239/p239_111.wav|p239|Instead, another depression came in.
DUMMY/p236/p236_337.wav|p236|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY/p225/p225_240.wav|p225|We are in the hat.
DUMMY/p248/p248_226.wav|p248|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY/p238/p238_171.wav|p238|I've no idea how it works.
DUMMY/p239/p239_050.wav|p239|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p249/p249_163.wav|p249|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_330.wav|p240|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY/p239/p239_372.wav|p239|That took about two years.
DUMMY/p232/p232_031.wav|p232|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p234/p234_099.wav|p234|That is the fact of the matter.
DUMMY/p228/p228_093.wav|p228|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p227/p227_057.wav|p227|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_341.wav|p230|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY/p240/p240_156.wav|p240|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY/p239/p239_240.wav|p239|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p248/p248_303.wav|p248|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY/p240/p240_050.wav|p240|Who can say?
DUMMY/p238/p238_051.wav|p238|And they removed a Borderer.
DUMMY/p234/p234_130.wav|p234|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY/p229/p229_016.wav|p229|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p229/p229_260.wav|p229|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY/p244/p244_052.wav|p244|The pressure on the players will build.
DUMMY/p231/p231_262.wav|p231|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_009.wav|p245|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p229/p229_215.wav|p229|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY/p247/p247_444.wav|p247|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_047.wav|p245|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p246/p246_130.wav|p246|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY/p239/p239_199.wav|p239|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY/p244/p244_264.wav|p244|It expected this trend to continue.
DUMMY/p244/p244_246.wav|p244|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_238.wav|p228|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY/p248/p248_150.wav|p248|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY/p240/p240_255.wav|p240|A friendship that will endure.
DUMMY/p238/p238_018.wav|p238|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p234/p234_096.wav|p234|I had a bit in hand.
DUMMY/p245/p245_015.wav|p245|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_314.wav|p241|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY/p229/p229_109.wav|p229|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p243/p243_159.wav|p243|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY/p231/p231_064.wav|p231|It was a lovely experience.
DUMMY/p230/p230_160.wav|p230|And does it ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_047.wav|p240|It is so sad.
DUMMY/p232/p232_014.wav|p232|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p239/p239_365.wav|p239|The scientific debate is dead.
DUMMY/p245/p245_040.wav|p245|It's a great thing.
DUMMY/p225/p225_224.wav|p225|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p228/p228_089.wav|p228|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY/p241/p241_090.wav|p241|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY/p239/p239_172.wav|p239|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
DUMMY/p236/p236_032.wav|p236|He should emerge as the winner.
DUMMY/p225/p225_223.wav|p225|The police have an awful lot to explain.
DUMMY/p238/p238_136.wav|p238|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY/p228/p228_177.wav|p228|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY/p234/p234_267.wav|p234|We can certainly build on this.
DUMMY/p225/p225_006.wav|p225|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p226/p226_229.wav|p226|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY/p239/p239_422.wav|p239|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
DUMMY/p243/p243_271.wav|p243|That's been the difference between the sides.
DUMMY/p226/p226_338.wav|p226|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY/p239/p239_127.wav|p239|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY/p244/p244_091.wav|p244|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY/p237/p237_147.wav|p237|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY/p226/p226_161.wav|p226|These days are long gone.
DUMMY/p225/p225_059.wav|p225|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY/p248/p248_309.wav|p248|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY/p244/p244_061.wav|p244|That was the difference today.
DUMMY/p239/p239_201.wav|p239|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY/p238/p238_303.wav|p238|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_358.wav|p231|I am a lucky man.
DUMMY/p243/p243_209.wav|p243|They are a victim of their own success.
DUMMY/p244/p244_143.wav|p244|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
DUMMY/p236/p236_426.wav|p236|Everything in golf is a balance.
DUMMY/p230/p230_052.wav|p230|None has ever been found.
DUMMY/p243/p243_210.wav|p243|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
DUMMY/p241/p241_249.wav|p241|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY/p244/p244_378.wav|p244|I was delighted to accept.
DUMMY/p244/p244_073.wav|p244|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p236/p236_028.wav|p236|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_352.wav|p228|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY/p246/p246_091.wav|p246|It was clear.
DUMMY/p239/p239_096.wav|p239|Kenny Miller might come through.
DUMMY/p234/p234_132.wav|p234|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY/p247/p247_240.wav|p247|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_331.wav|p229|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p248/p248_211.wav|p248|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY/p248/p248_363.wav|p248|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY/p246/p246_306.wav|p246|We could easily be cut again.
DUMMY/p231/p231_464.wav|p231|Driving has been the key.
DUMMY/p231/p231_039.wav|p231|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
DUMMY/p226/p226_223.wav|p226|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY/p231/p231_278.wav|p231|The joint bid is still on course.
DUMMY/p230/p230_411.wav|p230|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY/p236/p236_380.wav|p236|People are on the alert.
DUMMY/p247/p247_048.wav|p247|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_076.wav|p230|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
DUMMY/p226/p226_266.wav|p226|The warning is timely.
DUMMY/p248/p248_333.wav|p248|I said that I had been raped.
DUMMY/p248/p248_317.wav|p248|He was unable to come.
DUMMY/p244/p244_383.wav|p244|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
DUMMY/p241/p241_095.wav|p241|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
DUMMY/p244/p244_393.wav|p244|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_330.wav|p241|Who was the mystery MP?
DUMMY/p248/p248_096.wav|p248|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p246/p246_301.wav|p246|What has altered?
DUMMY/p244/p244_072.wav|p244|It is only the beginning.
DUMMY/p239/p239_083.wav|p239|But the organisers refused to worry.
DUMMY/p249/p249_036.wav|p249|It was clear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_226.wav|p236|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY/p243/p243_367.wav|p243|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
DUMMY/p238/p238_120.wav|p238|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_021.wav|p234|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p240/p240_104.wav|p240|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY/p239/p239_049.wav|p239|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY/p245/p245_012.wav|p245|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p236/p236_091.wav|p236|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p243/p243_105.wav|p243|I bought a flat six years ago.
DUMMY/p243/p243_195.wav|p243|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_021.wav|p228|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p244/p244_200.wav|p244|He has defended the system.
DUMMY/p234/p234_264.wav|p234|Scotland played a major part in the project.
DUMMY/p243/p243_198.wav|p243|But they had to be paid for.
DUMMY/p245/p245_106.wav|p245|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY/p236/p236_222.wav|p236|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY/p240/p240_323.wav|p240|Henman has been warned.
DUMMY/p240/p240_325.wav|p240|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY/p237/p237_201.wav|p237|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY/p248/p248_017.wav|p248|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p248/p248_265.wav|p248|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY/p230/p230_218.wav|p230|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY/p230/p230_005.wav|p230|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p234/p234_360.wav|p234|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p239/p239_309.wav|p239|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
DUMMY/p234/p234_144.wav|p234|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY/p238/p238_295.wav|p238|It has been recorded twice.
DUMMY/p239/p239_159.wav|p239|It was the climax of the thing.
DUMMY/p231/p231_283.wav|p231|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY/p239/p239_340.wav|p239|It will affect their work.
DUMMY/p234/p234_337.wav|p234|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY/p243/p243_199.wav|p243|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
DUMMY/p237/p237_070.wav|p237|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY/p229/p229_301.wav|p229|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p234/p234_084.wav|p234|It is not a story.
DUMMY/p226/p226_191.wav|p226|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY/p246/p246_334.wav|p246|I've got no secret.
DUMMY/p246/p246_097.wav|p246|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY/p234/p234_094.wav|p234|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY/p247/p247_344.wav|p247|What are they for ?)
DUMMY/p247/p247_181.wav|p247|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_218.wav|p241|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY/p229/p229_302.wav|p229|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY/p236/p236_270.wav|p236|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY/p229/p229_111.wav|p229|It is normal.
DUMMY/p232/p232_187.wav|p232|I've been there.
DUMMY/p249/p249_202.wav|p249|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY/p248/p248_161.wav|p248|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY/p232/p232_116.wav|p232|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY/p229/p229_277.wav|p229|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p230/p230_007.wav|p230|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p226/p226_141.wav|p226|Our intentions are real.
DUMMY/p248/p248_035.wav|p248|I expected these kind of questions.
DUMMY/p228/p228_152.wav|p228|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p227/p227_294.wav|p227|But the plot is not the point.
DUMMY/p249/p249_348.wav|p249|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY/p237/p237_170.wav|p237|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY/p249/p249_322.wav|p249|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY/p239/p239_454.wav|p239|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY/p243/p243_260.wav|p243|And they never show the same film as a rival.
DUMMY/p229/p229_171.wav|p229|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY/p234/p234_116.wav|p234|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p238/p238_271.wav|p238|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
DUMMY/p232/p232_064.wav|p232|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY/p239/p239_355.wav|p239|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_336.wav|p245|Action is needed now.
DUMMY/p227/p227_044.wav|p227|If I was a woman.
DUMMY/p226/p226_057.wav|p226|It's the big omission.
DUMMY/p244/p244_028.wav|p244|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p228/p228_338.wav|p228|This is a friendly match ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_241.wav|p245|They are different types.
DUMMY/p245/p245_305.wav|p245|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY/p236/p236_220.wav|p236|You are a great player.
DUMMY/p248/p248_158.wav|p248|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY/p226/p226_121.wav|p226|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY/p227/p227_266.wav|p227|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_362.wav|p244|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY/p228/p228_085.wav|p228|But she might be.
DUMMY/p239/p239_325.wav|p239|It wasn't about her singing, though.
DUMMY/p238/p238_458.wav|p238|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
DUMMY/p247/p247_363.wav|p247|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_189.wav|p231|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY/p249/p249_206.wav|p249|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY/p243/p243_110.wav|p243|Some young girls also came by last night.
DUMMY/p239/p239_359.wav|p239|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY/p239/p239_366.wav|p239|This would include the GM food industry.
DUMMY/p231/p231_378.wav|p231|to have products for their needs.
DUMMY/p243/p243_057.wav|p243|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
DUMMY/p227/p227_200.wav|p227|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY/p225/p225_363.wav|p225|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
DUMMY/p241/p241_359.wav|p241|So I left.
DUMMY/p231/p231_340.wav|p231|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY/p245/p245_008.wav|p245|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p248/p248_032.wav|p248|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p240/p240_028.wav|p240|Is this accurate?
DUMMY/p237/p237_151.wav|p237|The idea is simple.
DUMMY/p239/p239_406.wav|p239|This game is very evenly balanced.
DUMMY/p237/p237_130.wav|p237|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY/p230/p230_283.wav|p230|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_312.wav|p232|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p248/p248_141.wav|p248|He has the edge.
DUMMY/p231/p231_371.wav|p231|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY/p230/p230_060.wav|p230|It's not covered by the insurance.
DUMMY/p238/p238_221.wav|p238|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
DUMMY/p246/p246_213.wav|p246|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p247/p247_302.wav|p247|I wanted to change the formula.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_451.wav|p238|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY/p240/p240_114.wav|p240|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY/p239/p239_139.wav|p239|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
DUMMY/p236/p236_340.wav|p236|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p239/p239_258.wav|p239|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
DUMMY/p232/p232_339.wav|p232|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY/p237/p237_042.wav|p237|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY/p228/p228_126.wav|p228|Who would be a referee ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_255.wav|p229|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY/p240/p240_336.wav|p240|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY/p238/p238_048.wav|p238|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY/p236/p236_423.wav|p236|It is an absolute nonsense.
DUMMY/p234/p234_211.wav|p234|The trading conditions are not good.
DUMMY/p226/p226_287.wav|p226|Who will perform?
DUMMY/p231/p231_324.wav|p231|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY/p249/p249_320.wav|p249|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY/p226/p226_202.wav|p226|They are in the euro.
DUMMY/p230/p230_273.wav|p230|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY/p247/p247_411.wav|p247|Does it matter ?)
DUMMY/p241/p241_113.wav|p241|It's not fair.
DUMMY/p244/p244_306.wav|p244|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY/p231/p231_465.wav|p231|She has now been registered as disabled.
DUMMY/p238/p238_422.wav|p238|The company declined to comment.
DUMMY/p236/p236_063.wav|p236|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY/p228/p228_098.wav|p228|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p236/p236_139.wav|p236|That view has not altered.
DUMMY/p247/p247_359.wav|p247|He said something in his work.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_189.wav|p237|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY/p247/p247_447.wav|p247|That will be best for him.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_301.wav|p236|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_071.wav|p245|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY/p245/p245_284.wav|p245|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY/p241/p241_296.wav|p241|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY/p245/p245_248.wav|p245|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY/p232/p232_346.wav|p232|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY/p236/p236_113.wav|p236|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p241/p241_142.wav|p241|He is severe.
DUMMY/p231/p231_079.wav|p231|Both agreed on the success of the event.
DUMMY/p236/p236_056.wav|p236|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p241/p241_162.wav|p241|We have to move forward.
DUMMY/p247/p247_312.wav|p247|I was there five months ago.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_138.wav|p245|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY/p232/p232_166.wav|p232|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY/p245/p245_155.wav|p245|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p236/p236_271.wav|p236|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY/p243/p243_257.wav|p243|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
DUMMY/p238/p238_251.wav|p238|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_223.wav|p247|His third goal was superb.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_262.wav|p247|Either way, the investor retains the premium.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_212.wav|p240|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p244/p244_189.wav|p244|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p241/p241_093.wav|p241|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
DUMMY/p249/p249_341.wav|p249|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY/p228/p228_308.wav|p228|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY/p234/p234_126.wav|p234|He wanted to record the group.
DUMMY/p229/p229_178.wav|p229|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
DUMMY/p243/p243_190.wav|p243|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
DUMMY/p246/p246_225.wav|p246|But she was.
DUMMY/p228/p228_076.wav|p228|It's all I can do.
DUMMY/p247/p247_173.wav|p247|We will turn the corner.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_443.wav|p236|We would have concerns about that.
DUMMY/p229/p229_088.wav|p229|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p246/p246_028.wav|p246|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY/p232/p232_385.wav|p232|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY/p228/p228_234.wav|p228|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY/p231/p231_088.wav|p231|He's been hit by it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_292.wav|p231|I've lost all confidence.
DUMMY/p226/p226_054.wav|p226|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY/p226/p226_020.wav|p226|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_146.wav|p249|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY/p238/p238_292.wav|p238|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY/p230/p230_026.wav|p230|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY/p231/p231_268.wav|p231|I've had the time of my life.
DUMMY/p248/p248_051.wav|p248|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p239/p239_067.wav|p239|Everyone could see the joke.
DUMMY/p248/p248_003.wav|p248|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p245/p245_144.wav|p245|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY/p236/p236_070.wav|p236|He was seen as the enemy.
DUMMY/p226/p226_169.wav|p226|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p237/p237_245.wav|p237|Of course, that is not the whole story.
DUMMY/p236/p236_157.wav|p236|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY/p231/p231_090.wav|p231|I saw the whole thing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_183.wav|p244|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY/p236/p236_141.wav|p236|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY/p248/p248_214.wav|p248|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY/p247/p247_077.wav|p247|I was as strong as a horse.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_289.wav|p236|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY/p232/p232_383.wav|p232|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY/p245/p245_274.wav|p245|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY/p249/p249_119.wav|p249|It was ugly.
DUMMY/p232/p232_152.wav|p232|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY/p247/p247_161.wav|p247|His second goal was equally impressive.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_179.wav|p227|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY/p236/p236_107.wav|p236|They will notice a difference.
DUMMY/p226/p226_257.wav|p226|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY/p247/p247_422.wav|p247|The projections are very positive for South Africa.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_203.wav|p240|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY/p249/p249_290.wav|p249|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p243/p243_371.wav|p243|We have been going for three years.
DUMMY/p239/p239_363.wav|p239|The actual increases will be announced next month.
DUMMY/p231/p231_113.wav|p231|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY/p229/p229_004.wav|p229|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p249/p249_246.wav|p249|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY/p238/p238_230.wav|p238|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p230/p230_131.wav|p230|She died at her home.
DUMMY/p232/p232_262.wav|p232|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
DUMMY/p246/p246_346.wav|p246|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY/p234/p234_237.wav|p234|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY/p245/p245_245.wav|p245|This year I understood.
DUMMY/p237/p237_344.wav|p237|The train was on time.
DUMMY/p229/p229_296.wav|p229|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY/p226/p226_226.wav|p226|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p226/p226_028.wav|p226|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_011.wav|p238|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p227/p227_219.wav|p227|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY/p234/p234_035.wav|p234|History is in the making.
DUMMY/p247/p247_010.wav|p247|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY/p243/p243_261.wav|p243|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
DUMMY/p229/p229_298.wav|p229|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p249/p249_310.wav|p249|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p245/p245_353.wav|p245|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY/p231/p231_128.wav|p231|That is far too high.
DUMMY/p225/p225_009.wav|p225|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p244/p244_407.wav|p244|It's great that it happened in Britain.
DUMMY/p228/p228_342.wav|p228|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY/p244/p244_195.wav|p244|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_392.wav|p238|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY/p230/p230_202.wav|p230|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY/p227/p227_068.wav|p227|He had been a singer.
DUMMY/p238/p238_368.wav|p238|We can have no complaints.
DUMMY/p237/p237_106.wav|p237|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY/p247/p247_206.wav|p247|The result is utterly compelling.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_249.wav|p248|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY/p240/p240_236.wav|p240|Jobs could go.
DUMMY/p230/p230_282.wav|p230|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_407.wav|p232|We should have known.
DUMMY/p230/p230_398.wav|p230|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_100.wav|p241|It was mayhem.
DUMMY/p244/p244_090.wav|p244|It seems a good thing to try.
DUMMY/p239/p239_018.wav|p239|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p240/p240_096.wav|p240|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY/p239/p239_361.wav|p239|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p236/p236_473.wav|p236|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY/p245/p245_200.wav|p245|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY/p228/p228_082.wav|p228|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p248/p248_335.wav|p248|The composer will conduct.
DUMMY/p234/p234_256.wav|p234|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
DUMMY/p249/p249_238.wav|p249|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY/p226/p226_097.wav|p226|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY/p238/p238_220.wav|p238|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY/p241/p241_121.wav|p241|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_301.wav|p244|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY/p244/p244_119.wav|p244|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY/p243/p243_333.wav|p243|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
DUMMY/p246/p246_168.wav|p246|He was a crazy man.
DUMMY/p230/p230_163.wav|p230|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY/p230/p230_213.wav|p230|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY/p244/p244_171.wav|p244|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY/p227/p227_274.wav|p227|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY/p226/p226_016.wav|p226|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p225/p225_035.wav|p225|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
DUMMY/p230/p230_093.wav|p230|But I know the course.
DUMMY/p239/p239_038.wav|p239|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_347.wav|p236|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY/p232/p232_325.wav|p232|Off with their heads.
DUMMY/p246/p246_294.wav|p246|It was good.
DUMMY/p236/p236_266.wav|p236|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY/p231/p231_395.wav|p231|A review is under way.
DUMMY/p238/p238_158.wav|p238|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY/p226/p226_366.wav|p226|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY/p226/p226_153.wav|p226|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY/p240/p240_090.wav|p240|That will come after the game on Saturday.
DUMMY/p249/p249_255.wav|p249|It is very important that we get the balance right.
DUMMY/p238/p238_267.wav|p238|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_103.wav|p237|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY/p249/p249_097.wav|p249|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_218.wav|p236|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY/p236/p236_148.wav|p236|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY/p232/p232_337.wav|p232|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
DUMMY/p226/p226_348.wav|p226|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY/p231/p231_131.wav|p231|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY/p244/p244_311.wav|p244|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY/p227/p227_298.wav|p227|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY/p232/p232_133.wav|p232|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p238/p238_054.wav|p238|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_017.wav|p226|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p226/p226_351.wav|p226|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY/p229/p229_241.wav|p229|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY/p234/p234_314.wav|p234|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY/p246/p246_200.wav|p246|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p241/p241_026.wav|p241|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY/p228/p228_077.wav|p228|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p227/p227_083.wav|p227|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p246/p246_100.wav|p246|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY/p248/p248_005.wav|p248|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p228/p228_298.wav|p228|It's certainly different.
DUMMY/p247/p247_310.wav|p247|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_041.wav|p249|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY/p247/p247_220.wav|p247|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY/p232/p232_162.wav|p232|Tell it like it was ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_148.wav|p244|I am the manager of Scotland.
DUMMY/p232/p232_400.wav|p232|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_122.wav|p244|He was not alone at the top of the board.
DUMMY/p230/p230_147.wav|p230|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
DUMMY/p249/p249_229.wav|p249|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY/p248/p248_056.wav|p248|But the law is very clear on this.
DUMMY/p238/p238_364.wav|p238|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY/p243/p243_051.wav|p243|I'm as fit as I can get.
DUMMY/p244/p244_019.wav|p244|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p227/p227_134.wav|p227|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY/p243/p243_118.wav|p243|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY/p236/p236_384.wav|p236|They know it'll be fantastic.
DUMMY/p231/p231_446.wav|p231|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY/p240/p240_248.wav|p240|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY/p243/p243_008.wav|p243|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p232/p232_314.wav|p232|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p244/p244_085.wav|p244|It starts with the script.
DUMMY/p243/p243_328.wav|p243|He is not exactly a pretty child.
DUMMY/p232/p232_188.wav|p232|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
DUMMY/p234/p234_248.wav|p234|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p239/p239_003.wav|p239|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p231/p231_089.wav|p231|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY/p244/p244_046.wav|p244|It is all about the story.
DUMMY/p249/p249_126.wav|p249|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p230/p230_021.wav|p230|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p247/p247_432.wav|p247|It was a breathtaking moment.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_259.wav|p248|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY/p241/p241_304.wav|p241|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY/p237/p237_010.wav|p237|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p249/p249_280.wav|p249|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY/p239/p239_124.wav|p239|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY/p247/p247_232.wav|p247|We played them off the pitch.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_299.wav|p239|Everyone can have their opinion.
DUMMY/p236/p236_098.wav|p236|We created so many chances.
DUMMY/p237/p237_216.wav|p237|It is a gamble.
DUMMY/p249/p249_068.wav|p249|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY/p245/p245_230.wav|p245|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY/p225/p225_297.wav|p225|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
DUMMY/p249/p249_178.wav|p249|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY/p247/p247_164.wav|p247|That view has not altered.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_206.wav|p244|We can take the city.
DUMMY/p247/p247_196.wav|p247|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_081.wav|p240|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY/p236/p236_371.wav|p236|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY/p232/p232_255.wav|p232|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY/p238/p238_245.wav|p238|I was a lucky man tonight.
DUMMY/p244/p244_382.wav|p244|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY/p243/p243_200.wav|p243|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
DUMMY/p240/p240_311.wav|p240|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p225/p225_200.wav|p225|It looked like a river.
DUMMY/p238/p238_410.wav|p238|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY/p244/p244_344.wav|p244|And the context is also completely different.
DUMMY/p244/p244_370.wav|p244|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
DUMMY/p249/p249_152.wav|p249|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY/p243/p243_342.wav|p243|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
DUMMY/p240/p240_306.wav|p240|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY/p240/p240_098.wav|p240|It was a good performance.
DUMMY/p229/p229_355.wav|p229|It is long gone.
DUMMY/p226/p226_171.wav|p226|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY/p236/p236_478.wav|p236|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
DUMMY/p227/p227_137.wav|p227|Our position is quite simple.
DUMMY/p241/p241_337.wav|p241|I must make that clear.
DUMMY/p237/p237_166.wav|p237|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY/p238/p238_239.wav|p238|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
DUMMY/p234/p234_117.wav|p234|And we had a good response.
DUMMY/p246/p246_134.wav|p246|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY/p230/p230_016.wav|p230|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p237/p237_305.wav|p237|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY/p231/p231_157.wav|p231|He was right into football from an early age.
DUMMY/p236/p236_076.wav|p236|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY/p229/p229_271.wav|p229|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY/p228/p228_127.wav|p228|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY/p232/p232_329.wav|p232|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY/p240/p240_012.wav|p240|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p247/p247_358.wav|p247|The pain is still acute.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_048.wav|p228|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
DUMMY/p227/p227_085.wav|p227|The latter is due to be finished in February.
DUMMY/p238/p238_019.wav|p238|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p244/p244_297.wav|p244|How independent is that ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_352.wav|p227|There was no time scale.
DUMMY/p232/p232_122.wav|p232|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p236/p236_496.wav|p236|They never gave up hope.
DUMMY/p243/p243_373.wav|p243|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
DUMMY/p247/p247_193.wav|p247|You know the sort of thing.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_284.wav|p246|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY/p245/p245_149.wav|p245|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p239/p239_446.wav|p239|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
DUMMY/p237/p237_125.wav|p237|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY/p249/p249_295.wav|p249|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p247/p247_199.wav|p247|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_091.wav|p234|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY/p245/p245_084.wav|p245|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY/p237/p237_012.wav|p237|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p238/p238_084.wav|p238|He's very young and very keen to do well.
DUMMY/p229/p229_074.wav|p229|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p226/p226_333.wav|p226|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY/p239/p239_332.wav|p239|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY/p234/p234_246.wav|p234|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_078.wav|p243|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
DUMMY/p228/p228_301.wav|p228|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY/p249/p249_306.wav|p249|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY/p249/p249_236.wav|p249|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY/p230/p230_298.wav|p230|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY/p236/p236_217.wav|p236|John Daly has a burning ambition.
DUMMY/p237/p237_321.wav|p237|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY/p241/p241_164.wav|p241|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p232/p232_169.wav|p232|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY/p238/p238_027.wav|p238|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY/p244/p244_308.wav|p244|Every character was completely different.
DUMMY/p236/p236_180.wav|p236|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_351.wav|p237|It should be scrapped.
DUMMY/p238/p238_229.wav|p238|That view has not altered.
DUMMY/p245/p245_139.wav|p245|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY/p240/p240_269.wav|p240|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY/p227/p227_209.wav|p227|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY/p240/p240_273.wav|p240|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY/p240/p240_265.wav|p240|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p244/p244_083.wav|p244|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_346.wav|p230|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
DUMMY/p244/p244_326.wav|p244|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY/p248/p248_272.wav|p248|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY/p248/p248_147.wav|p248|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p228/p228_122.wav|p228|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY/p237/p237_263.wav|p237|They are different types.
DUMMY/p247/p247_046.wav|p247|It's not a swimming pool out there.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_063.wav|p239|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY/p236/p236_419.wav|p236|They were not complacent in any way.
DUMMY/p231/p231_049.wav|p231|There's nothing we could do about this.
DUMMY/p246/p246_206.wav|p246|I have decided to quit the show.
DUMMY/p243/p243_104.wav|p243|They won't actually make any money from it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_208.wav|p247|This will take several weeks.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_323.wav|p228|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY/p232/p232_348.wav|p232|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY/p244/p244_201.wav|p244|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
DUMMY/p244/p244_058.wav|p244|This trend is likely to strengthen.
DUMMY/p243/p243_005.wav|p243|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p247/p247_253.wav|p247|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_131.wav|p227|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
DUMMY/p241/p241_227.wav|p241|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY/p246/p246_080.wav|p246|A play is a set of actions.
DUMMY/p228/p228_136.wav|p228|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY/p238/p238_232.wav|p238|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
DUMMY/p245/p245_285.wav|p245|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY/p240/p240_068.wav|p240|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY/p244/p244_087.wav|p244|It would have been around the turn of the century.
DUMMY/p228/p228_112.wav|p228|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p228/p228_150.wav|p228|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_314.wav|p239|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_446.wav|p238|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY/p227/p227_313.wav|p227|It could well be military.
DUMMY/p244/p244_309.wav|p244|But it is a similar problem.
DUMMY/p241/p241_057.wav|p241|What was the main difference?
DUMMY/p226/p226_120.wav|p226|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY/p225/p225_258.wav|p225|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY/p229/p229_346.wav|p229|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p243/p243_311.wav|p243|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY/p225/p225_348.wav|p225|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_240.wav|p236|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY/p238/p238_025.wav|p238|Smoking is also very important.
DUMMY/p234/p234_229.wav|p234|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
DUMMY/p229/p229_308.wav|p229|It's just not funny !
DUMMY/p247/p247_133.wav|p247|The answer was in space.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_320.wav|p225|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY/p234/p234_270.wav|p234|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
DUMMY/p225/p225_071.wav|p225|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p234/p234_020.wav|p234|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_223.wav|p227|That might help a bit.
DUMMY/p241/p241_198.wav|p241|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
DUMMY/p249/p249_144.wav|p249|He is severe.
DUMMY/p239/p239_021.wav|p239|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p234/p234_106.wav|p234|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY/p240/p240_154.wav|p240|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY/p248/p248_230.wav|p248|It's the same as Glasgow.
DUMMY/p247/p247_051.wav|p247|We would have concerns about suspension.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_225.wav|p229|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY/p237/p237_288.wav|p237|You know the type.
DUMMY/p241/p241_107.wav|p241|It was his job to check.
DUMMY/p247/p247_153.wav|p247|Does the name matter ?)
DUMMY/p227/p227_162.wav|p227|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
DUMMY/p238/p238_257.wav|p238|It was a terrible combination of factors.
DUMMY/p234/p234_216.wav|p234|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY/p229/p229_320.wav|p229|It's not even finished.
DUMMY/p229/p229_198.wav|p229|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY/p238/p238_181.wav|p238|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
DUMMY/p240/p240_192.wav|p240|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p241/p241_260.wav|p241|It was good fun.
DUMMY/p227/p227_108.wav|p227|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY/p231/p231_164.wav|p231|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY/p244/p244_047.wav|p244|The whole thing is the music.
DUMMY/p246/p246_258.wav|p246|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p238/p238_402.wav|p238|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
DUMMY/p225/p225_108.wav|p225|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY/p239/p239_034.wav|p239|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY/p240/p240_178.wav|p240|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY/p228/p228_074.wav|p228|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p236/p236_386.wav|p236|Clark is back on top form.
DUMMY/p239/p239_480.wav|p239|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY/p230/p230_089.wav|p230|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
DUMMY/p248/p248_350.wav|p248|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY/p229/p229_381.wav|p229|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY/p232/p232_058.wav|p232|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY/p234/p234_227.wav|p234|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
DUMMY/p237/p237_185.wav|p237|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY/p243/p243_294.wav|p243|The agreement remains the only show in town.
DUMMY/p237/p237_343.wav|p237|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY/p229/p229_039.wav|p229|They're just different.
DUMMY/p234/p234_170.wav|p234|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
DUMMY/p247/p247_157.wav|p247|I love the spectacle of cinema.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_281.wav|p237|There is no link.
DUMMY/p239/p239_012.wav|p239|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p249/p249_128.wav|p249|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p231/p231_334.wav|p231|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY/p230/p230_210.wav|p230|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p228/p228_229.wav|p228|It's so special.
DUMMY/p244/p244_123.wav|p244|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
DUMMY/p244/p244_285.wav|p244|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY/p244/p244_391.wav|p244|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_085.wav|p230|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p237/p237_160.wav|p237|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY/p237/p237_248.wav|p237|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY/p225/p225_291.wav|p225|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
DUMMY/p243/p243_044.wav|p243|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_228.wav|p226|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY/p230/p230_208.wav|p230|This will take several weeks.
DUMMY/p234/p234_207.wav|p234|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_129.wav|p232|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY/p228/p228_151.wav|p228|That should do it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_366.wav|p240|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p243/p243_077.wav|p243|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
DUMMY/p246/p246_198.wav|p246|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY/p239/p239_128.wav|p239|How independent is that ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_427.wav|p238|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY/p243/p243_264.wav|p243|The two companies were not for sale.
DUMMY/p244/p244_242.wav|p244|He is a man of the people.
DUMMY/p234/p234_259.wav|p234|It was a great experience.
DUMMY/p236/p236_055.wav|p236|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY/p232/p232_091.wav|p232|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY/p236/p236_025.wav|p236|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
DUMMY/p234/p234_139.wav|p234|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_068.wav|p231|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY/p226/p226_349.wav|p226|He's been the key to everything.
DUMMY/p232/p232_242.wav|p232|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY/p226/p226_297.wav|p226|There's a pause.
DUMMY/p236/p236_058.wav|p236|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY/p228/p228_242.wav|p228|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY/p249/p249_070.wav|p249|Have a look at our accounts.
DUMMY/p228/p228_350.wav|p228|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY/p228/p228_040.wav|p228|My whole life has changed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_203.wav|p229|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p234/p234_311.wav|p234|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY/p247/p247_116.wav|p247|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_087.wav|p237|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY/p241/p241_358.wav|p241|That would help.
DUMMY/p232/p232_159.wav|p232|We have to move forward.
DUMMY/p243/p243_237.wav|p243|He has worked for several years in the United States.
DUMMY/p238/p238_258.wav|p238|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY/p226/p226_077.wav|p226|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY/p234/p234_226.wav|p234|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY/p225/p225_221.wav|p225|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p240/p240_167.wav|p240|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY/p239/p239_467.wav|p239|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
DUMMY/p230/p230_116.wav|p230|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
DUMMY/p241/p241_183.wav|p241|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY/p231/p231_061.wav|p231|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_228.wav|p238|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
DUMMY/p230/p230_302.wav|p230|He is at war with his knee.
DUMMY/p239/p239_193.wav|p239|In addition, margins have been maintained.
DUMMY/p230/p230_023.wav|p230|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p236/p236_053.wav|p236|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_249.wav|p245|I can't get a job.
DUMMY/p246/p246_251.wav|p246|I can't get a job.
DUMMY/p234/p234_027.wav|p234|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
DUMMY/p226/p226_043.wav|p226|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY/p230/p230_086.wav|p230|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY/p229/p229_183.wav|p229|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY/p247/p247_103.wav|p247|She has so much to offer.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_032.wav|p245|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p231/p231_021.wav|p231|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p237/p237_122.wav|p237|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p229/p229_379.wav|p229|It's a long process.
DUMMY/p249/p249_087.wav|p249|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY/p236/p236_185.wav|p236|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p232/p232_168.wav|p232|That will do for me.
DUMMY/p248/p248_204.wav|p248|Today was first class.
DUMMY/p227/p227_217.wav|p227|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY/p227/p227_013.wav|p227|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p245/p245_053.wav|p245|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY/p227/p227_099.wav|p227|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY/p246/p246_357.wav|p246|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY/p247/p247_366.wav|p247|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_205.wav|p228|I have a cold.
DUMMY/p248/p248_183.wav|p248|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY/p228/p228_321.wav|p228|Robert is a special talent.
DUMMY/p227/p227_285.wav|p227|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_075.wav|p237|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY/p231/p231_002.wav|p231|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p227/p227_062.wav|p227|They have to come up with a solution.
DUMMY/p247/p247_371.wav|p247|The members have voted against it.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_231.wav|p247|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_067.wav|p244|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY/p227/p227_160.wav|p227|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY/p238/p238_052.wav|p238|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p230/p230_235.wav|p230|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY/p234/p234_260.wav|p234|They are difficult awards to decide.
DUMMY/p247/p247_436.wav|p247|There is another important factor.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_345.wav|p227|The king is delighted by the honour.
DUMMY/p227/p227_208.wav|p227|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY/p227/p227_282.wav|p227|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY/p226/p226_026.wav|p226|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY/p234/p234_316.wav|p234|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p243/p243_151.wav|p243|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_064.wav|p237|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY/p236/p236_165.wav|p236|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p229/p229_361.wav|p229|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p232/p232_292.wav|p232|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY/p234/p234_107.wav|p234|Everyone had to play the game.
DUMMY/p237/p237_280.wav|p237|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY/p231/p231_416.wav|p231|There is some light in the tunnel.
DUMMY/p226/p226_307.wav|p226|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY/p246/p246_305.wav|p246|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY/p238/p238_380.wav|p238|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY/p248/p248_178.wav|p248|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
DUMMY/p241/p241_229.wav|p241|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY/p227/p227_176.wav|p227|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY/p227/p227_291.wav|p227|It was an easy decision to come here.
DUMMY/p247/p247_135.wav|p247|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_141.wav|p230|It has to be an event.
DUMMY/p247/p247_214.wav|p247|I had relied on him.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_026.wav|p231|I'd just like to play.
DUMMY/p239/p239_002.wav|p239|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p241/p241_214.wav|p241|It's been a good year.
DUMMY/p244/p244_411.wav|p244|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY/p226/p226_014.wav|p226|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p247/p247_473.wav|p247|We will now look into its historical background.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_059.wav|p238|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY/p241/p241_084.wav|p241|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY/p226/p226_150.wav|p226|We just had a go.
DUMMY/p239/p239_196.wav|p239|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
DUMMY/p246/p246_219.wav|p246|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY/p228/p228_250.wav|p228|I can't get a job.
DUMMY/p246/p246_033.wav|p246|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY/p228/p228_145.wav|p228|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY/p226/p226_134.wav|p226|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY/p225/p225_072.wav|p225|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_145.wav|p249|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY/p239/p239_447.wav|p239|Hard cash is needed now.
DUMMY/p247/p247_222.wav|p247|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_320.wav|p241|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY/p238/p238_440.wav|p238|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
DUMMY/p238/p238_302.wav|p238|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_145.wav|p225|Why change it ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_263.wav|p246|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY/p236/p236_247.wav|p236|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_109.wav|p226|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_052.wav|p239|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY/p248/p248_292.wav|p248|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p236/p236_379.wav|p236|The seller was not revealed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_162.wav|p229|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY/p226/p226_052.wav|p226|It is the whole package.
DUMMY/p227/p227_231.wav|p227|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY/p231/p231_217.wav|p231|He has a lot of skill.
DUMMY/p228/p228_368.wav|p228|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY/p240/p240_183.wav|p240|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p229/p229_159.wav|p229|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p240/p240_153.wav|p240|Mr Blair had done well.
DUMMY/p236/p236_005.wav|p236|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p236/p236_425.wav|p236|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
DUMMY/p229/p229_251.wav|p229|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p249/p249_002.wav|p249|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p241/p241_244.wav|p241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY/p240/p240_059.wav|p240|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p231/p231_392.wav|p231|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY/p239/p239_105.wav|p239|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY/p241/p241_101.wav|p241|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p247/p247_160.wav|p247|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_219.wav|p226|I might come back.
DUMMY/p226/p226_232.wav|p226|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY/p248/p248_168.wav|p248|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p241/p241_157.wav|p241|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY/p247/p247_108.wav|p247|We made a world record together.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_459.wav|p231|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY/p244/p244_175.wav|p244|All the pressure was on him.
DUMMY/p226/p226_137.wav|p226|It will be too hot.
DUMMY/p247/p247_148.wav|p247|What happened in that game ?)
DUMMY/p230/p230_286.wav|p230|That was a gold medal for certain.
DUMMY/p238/p238_241.wav|p238|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p232/p232_343.wav|p232|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY/p231/p231_282.wav|p231|That view has not altered.
DUMMY/p248/p248_053.wav|p248|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p229/p229_274.wav|p229|We're in shock.
DUMMY/p231/p231_178.wav|p231|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY/p249/p249_077.wav|p249|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY/p227/p227_079.wav|p227|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
DUMMY/p238/p238_262.wav|p238|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY/p234/p234_113.wav|p234|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
DUMMY/p225/p225_192.wav|p225|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_379.wav|p238|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
DUMMY/p229/p229_338.wav|p229|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY/p231/p231_047.wav|p231|A win is a win.
DUMMY/p249/p249_164.wav|p249|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY/p237/p237_153.wav|p237|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY/p229/p229_221.wav|p229|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_008.wav|p229|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p240/p240_151.wav|p240|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY/p236/p236_030.wav|p236|And we have a singer.
DUMMY/p245/p245_050.wav|p245|Who can say?
DUMMY/p248/p248_102.wav|p248|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY/p230/p230_164.wav|p230|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY/p241/p241_134.wav|p241|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY/p230/p230_142.wav|p230|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p248/p248_364.wav|p248|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY/p237/p237_161.wav|p237|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p240/p240_235.wav|p240|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_172.wav|p241|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p236/p236_161.wav|p236|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY/p247/p247_443.wav|p247|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_304.wav|p246|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p247/p247_031.wav|p247|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_207.wav|p232|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_294.wav|p247|It was never a free kick.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_076.wav|p238|I am relishing the challenge.
DUMMY/p234/p234_077.wav|p234|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY/p244/p244_082.wav|p244|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_141.wav|p241|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.

DUMMY/p245/p245_232.wav|p245|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY/p228/p228_146.wav|p228|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY/p230/p230_037.wav|p230|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY/p226/p226_063.wav|p226|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY/p230/p230_198.wav|p230|I made a terrible start.
DUMMY/p230/p230_028.wav|p230|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY/p234/p234_019.wav|p234|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p230/p230_123.wav|p230|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY/p229/p229_005.wav|p229|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p236/p236_420.wav|p236|They did the right thing.
DUMMY/p226/p226_083.wav|p226|It works for us.
DUMMY/p234/p234_284.wav|p234|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY/p241/p241_088.wav|p241|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY/p240/p240_245.wav|p240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY/p229/p229_042.wav|p229|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY/p247/p247_401.wav|p247|It proved a good decision.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_176.wav|p226|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY/p227/p227_203.wav|p227|It was served by sheriff officers.
DUMMY/p239/p239_386.wav|p239|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY/p240/p240_260.wav|p240|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p232/p232_111.wav|p232|He was jailed for a year.
DUMMY/p231/p231_218.wav|p231|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
DUMMY/p234/p234_082.wav|p234|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY/p249/p249_210.wav|p249|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY/p243/p243_335.wav|p243|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
DUMMY/p232/p232_191.wav|p232|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY/p238/p238_334.wav|p238|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
DUMMY/p230/p230_326.wav|p230|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY/p247/p247_038.wav|p247|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_237.wav|p227|We can certainly build on this.
DUMMY/p239/p239_423.wav|p239|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
DUMMY/p226/p226_122.wav|p226|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY/p230/p230_372.wav|p230|This is a major championship.
DUMMY/p244/p244_360.wav|p244|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY/p247/p247_241.wav|p247|She was an only child.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_311.wav|p239|Celtic were the losers then.
DUMMY/p231/p231_091.wav|p231|But I know the course.
DUMMY/p225/p225_301.wav|p225|I must do something about it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_007.wav|p245|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p236/p236_179.wav|p236|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_219.wav|p245|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY/p238/p238_270.wav|p238|It's never great to finish second.
DUMMY/p238/p238_091.wav|p238|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY/p227/p227_296.wav|p227|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY/p239/p239_428.wav|p239|Or maybe it's the other way around.
DUMMY/p232/p232_241.wav|p232|It's quite nice.
DUMMY/p229/p229_084.wav|p229|He can do everything.
DUMMY/p232/p232_052.wav|p232|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY/p239/p239_080.wav|p239|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
DUMMY/p231/p231_288.wav|p231|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY/p240/p240_055.wav|p240|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY/p225/p225_285.wav|p225|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY/p227/p227_245.wav|p227|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY/p238/p238_089.wav|p238|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
DUMMY/p247/p247_124.wav|p247|We have the mental strength.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_088.wav|p248|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY/p241/p241_052.wav|p241|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY/p246/p246_169.wav|p246|As we worked.
DUMMY/p230/p230_049.wav|p230|We have to bring in new players.
DUMMY/p241/p241_295.wav|p241|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY/p230/p230_180.wav|p230|She has left the island.
DUMMY/p241/p241_069.wav|p241|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY/p231/p231_142.wav|p231|It only increased the support for him.
DUMMY/p231/p231_053.wav|p231|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
DUMMY/p248/p248_090.wav|p248|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY/p226/p226_359.wav|p226|He's very explosive.
DUMMY/p249/p249_131.wav|p249|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY/p229/p229_101.wav|p229|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY/p249/p249_023.wav|p249|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p227/p227_288.wav|p227|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY/p246/p246_005.wav|p246|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p244/p244_422.wav|p244|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY/p240/p240_201.wav|p240|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p244/p244_241.wav|p244|All will be revealed in due course.
DUMMY/p239/p239_479.wav|p239|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
DUMMY/p231/p231_383.wav|p231|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_285.wav|p226|It was a virus.
DUMMY/p230/p230_231.wav|p230|Things were so intense in the studio.
DUMMY/p243/p243_380.wav|p243|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY/p245/p245_079.wav|p245|We have other options.
DUMMY/p245/p245_043.wav|p245|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY/p248/p248_376.wav|p248|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
DUMMY/p226/p226_125.wav|p226|She's got to say something.
DUMMY/p231/p231_003.wav|p231|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p236/p236_260.wav|p236|It is very hard for her.
DUMMY/p231/p231_150.wav|p231|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p229/p229_236.wav|p229|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY/p229/p229_244.wav|p229|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY/p234/p234_131.wav|p234|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY/p241/p241_228.wav|p241|Who would be right?
DUMMY/p247/p247_285.wav|p247|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_382.wav|p247|There is no deal as yet.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_007.wav|p246|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p238/p238_182.wav|p238|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
DUMMY/p237/p237_190.wav|p237|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY/p226/p226_308.wav|p226|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY/p247/p247_329.wav|p247|Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_086.wav|p244|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY/p225/p225_028.wav|p225|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_315.wav|p245|They had a confession.
DUMMY/p228/p228_240.wav|p228|She was well balanced.
DUMMY/p236/p236_009.wav|p236|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p238/p238_080.wav|p238|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY/p243/p243_385.wav|p243|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_312.wav|p243|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
DUMMY/p236/p236_402.wav|p236|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_327.wav|p243|I try to be open to experience.
DUMMY/p249/p249_108.wav|p249|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
DUMMY/p248/p248_028.wav|p248|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY/p238/p238_298.wav|p238|They will probably come back.
DUMMY/p238/p238_356.wav|p238|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
DUMMY/p234/p234_121.wav|p234|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_317.wav|p243|He will just go on doing his job.
DUMMY/p236/p236_279.wav|p236|He took over our lives.
DUMMY/p244/p244_357.wav|p244|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY/p239/p239_238.wav|p239|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY/p240/p240_169.wav|p240|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_423.wav|p244|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
DUMMY/p245/p245_025.wav|p245|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY/p239/p239_148.wav|p239|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY/p249/p249_281.wav|p249|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY/p247/p247_403.wav|p247|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_305.wav|p232|They are wrong.
DUMMY/p244/p244_109.wav|p244|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY/p249/p249_127.wav|p249|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY/p236/p236_458.wav|p236|And it covers the spectrum.
DUMMY/p232/p232_121.wav|p232|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY/p238/p238_128.wav|p238|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY/p230/p230_388.wav|p230|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY/p247/p247_003.wav|p247|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
DUMMY/p227/p227_317.wav|p227|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY/p246/p246_327.wav|p246|Is that an issue?
DUMMY/p239/p239_132.wav|p239|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_013.wav|p249|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p231/p231_363.wav|p231|We live on an island.
DUMMY/p231/p231_040.wav|p231|Last year, I was pretty bad.
DUMMY/p249/p249_314.wav|p249|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_193.wav|p241|Off I went.
DUMMY/p238/p238_264.wav|p238|It is a terrible tragedy.
DUMMY/p236/p236_440.wav|p236|But by that time, it was too late.
DUMMY/p225/p225_212.wav|p225|After that nothing could save him.
DUMMY/p234/p234_333.wav|p234|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY/p228/p228_130.wav|p228|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY/p236/p236_304.wav|p236|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p241/p241_136.wav|p241|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p248/p248_274.wav|p248|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY/p247/p247_440.wav|p247|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_282.wav|p246|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY/p240/p240_126.wav|p240|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY/p241/p241_124.wav|p241|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY/p240/p240_122.wav|p240|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY/p249/p249_331.wav|p249|The same things will happen with GM foods.
DUMMY/p247/p247_076.wav|p247|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_257.wav|p245|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY/p236/p236_124.wav|p236|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY/p236/p236_259.wav|p236|It was quite a new prescription.
DUMMY/p232/p232_224.wav|p232|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY/p226/p226_302.wav|p226|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY/p241/p241_122.wav|p241|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY/p236/p236_151.wav|p236|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY/p248/p248_058.wav|p248|It's very odd.
DUMMY/p244/p244_339.wav|p244|Like many companies, it is a problem.
DUMMY/p248/p248_319.wav|p248|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY/p240/p240_075.wav|p240|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY/p228/p228_231.wav|p228|He is severe.
DUMMY/p237/p237_142.wav|p237|He has the edge.
DUMMY/p247/p247_179.wav|p247|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_360.wav|p243|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY/p246/p246_090.wav|p246|This one did.
DUMMY/p228/p228_320.wav|p228|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
DUMMY/p225/p225_094.wav|p225|That's as it should be.
DUMMY/p232/p232_391.wav|p232|You thought it was a headache.
DUMMY/p244/p244_420.wav|p244|That might mean another delay.
DUMMY/p239/p239_107.wav|p239|There could be a way back.
DUMMY/p243/p243_394.wav|p243|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
DUMMY/p239/p239_293.wav|p239|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
DUMMY/p239/p239_117.wav|p239|Those people must be accountable.
DUMMY/p248/p248_190.wav|p248|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY/p230/p230_334.wav|p230|It was always an option.
DUMMY/p238/p238_030.wav|p238|Further management changes are planned.
DUMMY/p226/p226_300.wav|p226|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p231/p231_245.wav|p231|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY/p227/p227_159.wav|p227|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY/p226/p226_050.wav|p226|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY/p239/p239_211.wav|p239|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
DUMMY/p241/p241_047.wav|p241|As she explains.
DUMMY/p232/p232_203.wav|p232|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY/p239/p239_044.wav|p239|It carried a double message.
DUMMY/p238/p238_424.wav|p238|Got to get my sunglasses.
DUMMY/p241/p241_155.wav|p241|Was this element always there?
DUMMY/p237/p237_226.wav|p237|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p231/p231_296.wav|p231|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY/p244/p244_001.wav|p244|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p236/p236_084.wav|p236|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
DUMMY/p228/p228_226.wav|p228|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
DUMMY/p232/p232_249.wav|p232|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY/p225/p225_191.wav|p225|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p249/p249_156.wav|p249|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY/p245/p245_320.wav|p245|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p247/p247_438.wav|p247|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_156.wav|p236|It was a funny feeling.
DUMMY/p245/p245_236.wav|p245|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY/p240/p240_296.wav|p240|It's like a high school play.
DUMMY/p232/p232_060.wav|p232|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY/p243/p243_318.wav|p243|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY/p229/p229_269.wav|p229|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY/p245/p245_242.wav|p245|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p237/p237_068.wav|p237|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p246/p246_214.wav|p246|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p244/p244_170.wav|p244|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
DUMMY/p238/p238_106.wav|p238|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY/p245/p245_078.wav|p245|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p239/p239_244.wav|p239|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_261.wav|p249|That's the only thing I will say.
DUMMY/p241/p241_189.wav|p241|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY/p230/p230_031.wav|p230|I'm so happy that she did.
DUMMY/p246/p246_326.wav|p246|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY/p241/p241_143.wav|p241|Is that Titanic?
DUMMY/p248/p248_215.wav|p248|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY/p229/p229_339.wav|p229|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY/p231/p231_210.wav|p231|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY/p240/p240_367.wav|p240|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY/p227/p227_019.wav|p227|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p227/p227_064.wav|p227|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY/p244/p244_147.wav|p244|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY/p245/p245_262.wav|p245|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY/p243/p243_040.wav|p243|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
DUMMY/p241/p241_299.wav|p241|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
DUMMY/p240/p240_082.wav|p240|What has changed?
DUMMY/p225/p225_316.wav|p225|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
DUMMY/p237/p237_243.wav|p237|It's a dead end.
DUMMY/p226/p226_075.wav|p226|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p245/p245_183.wav|p245|I have a cold.
DUMMY/p236/p236_363.wav|p236|We must put a marker down.
DUMMY/p225/p225_302.wav|p225|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY/p225/p225_325.wav|p225|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
DUMMY/p245/p245_250.wav|p245|It is nearly there.
DUMMY/p243/p243_087.wav|p243|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
DUMMY/p231/p231_317.wav|p231|They come to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY/p229/p229_281.wav|p229|People have no choice.
DUMMY/p231/p231_265.wav|p231|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_236.wav|p230|It had so much to do with output.
DUMMY/p230/p230_254.wav|p230|She took them for a term.
DUMMY/p231/p231_364.wav|p231|It is not real life.
DUMMY/p225/p225_289.wav|p225|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY/p247/p247_237.wav|p247|The scientific debate is dead.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_363.wav|p226|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY/p230/p230_391.wav|p230|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY/p229/p229_001.wav|p229|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p227/p227_157.wav|p227|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY/p239/p239_166.wav|p239|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY/p244/p244_305.wav|p244|There was a hole in it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_097.wav|p229|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p243/p243_330.wav|p243|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
DUMMY/p231/p231_244.wav|p231|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
DUMMY/p234/p234_296.wav|p234|The results are expected within days.
DUMMY/p241/p241_219.wav|p241|IT S the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY/p243/p243_282.wav|p243|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
DUMMY/p239/p239_279.wav|p239|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p245/p245_180.wav|p245|Is that success?
DUMMY/p227/p227_315.wav|p227|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY/p244/p244_230.wav|p244|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY/p248/p248_344.wav|p248|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p248/p248_109.wav|p248|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY/p241/p241_268.wav|p241|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY/p231/p231_360.wav|p231|I've always been a sensitive.
DUMMY/p244/p244_396.wav|p244|I understand the frustration of the fans.
DUMMY/p243/p243_092.wav|p243|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
DUMMY/p243/p243_323.wav|p243|We still think this trade is on the increase.
DUMMY/p246/p246_104.wav|p246|It was an adventure.
DUMMY/p247/p247_191.wav|p247|I put the drawing down.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_009.wav|p238|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p241/p241_068.wav|p241|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p238/p238_397.wav|p238|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
DUMMY/p240/p240_101.wav|p240|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY/p229/p229_325.wav|p229|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p226/p226_227.wav|p226|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY/p229/p229_242.wav|p229|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY/p247/p247_171.wav|p247|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_209.wav|p231|We are a new department.
DUMMY/p227/p227_369.wav|p227|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p249/p249_305.wav|p249|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY/p247/p247_450.wav|p247|It certainly appeared that way.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_143.wav|p237|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY/p247/p247_283.wav|p247|They must play for each other.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_369.wav|p239|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY/p237/p237_013.wav|p237|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p238/p238_214.wav|p238|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
DUMMY/p232/p232_320.wav|p232|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY/p247/p247_303.wav|p247|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_239.wav|p234|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY/p236/p236_074.wav|p236|We did it for the jersey.
DUMMY/p230/p230_284.wav|p230|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_170.wav|p236|That is not the case.
DUMMY/p239/p239_024.wav|p239|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p228/p228_336.wav|p228|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY/p240/p240_213.wav|p240|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY/p241/p241_245.wav|p241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p228/p228_110.wav|p228|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p228/p228_134.wav|p228|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY/p238/p238_376.wav|p238|I have little time for analysts.
DUMMY/p232/p232_039.wav|p232|I was scared.
DUMMY/p243/p243_093.wav|p243|They had the appeal of TV stars.
DUMMY/p245/p245_004.wav|p245|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p247/p247_092.wav|p247|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_382.wav|p239|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_172.wav|p229|I will tell you.
DUMMY/p240/p240_346.wav|p240|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY/p248/p248_007.wav|p248|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p246/p246_265.wav|p246|There is no link.
DUMMY/p237/p237_317.wav|p237|It is no surprise.
DUMMY/p229/p229_032.wav|p229|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_089.wav|p225|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
DUMMY/p244/p244_066.wav|p244|There is a lot to be done.
DUMMY/p240/p240_158.wav|p240|Was this element always there?
DUMMY/p249/p249_182.wav|p249|The jury is still out.
DUMMY/p230/p230_276.wav|p230|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY/p246/p246_313.wav|p246|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY/p229/p229_257.wav|p229|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY/p237/p237_339.wav|p237|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY/p245/p245_207.wav|p245|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY/p232/p232_210.wav|p232|That's the day job.
DUMMY/p248/p248_205.wav|p248|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY/p226/p226_039.wav|p226|It has failed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_142.wav|p239|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY/p249/p249_135.wav|p249|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY/p239/p239_210.wav|p239|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY/p239/p239_373.wav|p239|He is obviously very dangerous.
DUMMY/p237/p237_176.wav|p237|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_473.wav|p239|The response from everyone was wonderful.
DUMMY/p225/p225_025.wav|p225|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_149.wav|p236|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY/p230/p230_350.wav|p230|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY/p231/p231_473.wav|p231|It was clear on Thursday.
DUMMY/p247/p247_293.wav|p247|I understand the security issue.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_217.wav|p237|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY/p240/p240_252.wav|p240|He got the same story.
DUMMY/p237/p237_086.wav|p237|It's never too late.
DUMMY/p246/p246_227.wav|p246|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY/p236/p236_060.wav|p236|I have proved that in the past.
DUMMY/p249/p249_104.wav|p249|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY/p227/p227_236.wav|p227|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY/p237/p237_097.wav|p237|I love the Dome.
DUMMY/p232/p232_050.wav|p232|They had to explain it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_158.wav|p245|Everyone can be bought.
DUMMY/p229/p229_125.wav|p229|It is rubbish.
DUMMY/p234/p234_325.wav|p234|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_215.wav|p236|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY/p227/p227_031.wav|p227|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY/p246/p246_303.wav|p246|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY/p246/p246_261.wav|p246|Souter will be back.
DUMMY/p246/p246_025.wav|p246|He has not been named.
DUMMY/p238/p238_146.wav|p238|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
DUMMY/p236/p236_418.wav|p236|I think it's a miracle.
DUMMY/p232/p232_284.wav|p232|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY/p230/p230_145.wav|p230|She has gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY/p246/p246_236.wav|p246|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
DUMMY/p245/p245_179.wav|p245|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY/p247/p247_250.wav|p247|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_172.wav|p230|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p244/p244_182.wav|p244|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY/p229/p229_265.wav|p229|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY/p247/p247_211.wav|p247|January is a bad time of year.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_058.wav|p238|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_134.wav|p249|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
DUMMY/p227/p227_156.wav|p227|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY/p226/p226_234.wav|p226|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
DUMMY/p240/p240_084.wav|p240|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY/p249/p249_217.wav|p249|This is a good move for me.
DUMMY/p231/p231_346.wav|p231|We are encouraged by the news.
DUMMY/p248/p248_288.wav|p248|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY/p236/p236_365.wav|p236|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY/p247/p247_212.wav|p247|His injury was completely random.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_167.wav|p229|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p247/p247_151.wav|p247|Why change it ?)
DUMMY/p249/p249_150.wav|p249|It is like a football team.
DUMMY/p238/p238_081.wav|p238|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY/p239/p239_503.wav|p239|The world record is suspicious.
DUMMY/p226/p226_011.wav|p226|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p247/p247_254.wav|p247|I have received no explanation.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_139.wav|p241|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY/p244/p244_156.wav|p244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
DUMMY/p246/p246_262.wav|p246|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY/p239/p239_415.wav|p239|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
DUMMY/p231/p231_207.wav|p231|You've caught a serial killer.
DUMMY/p227/p227_263.wav|p227|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY/p249/p249_271.wav|p249|It's not even finished.
DUMMY/p231/p231_221.wav|p231|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY/p240/p240_020.wav|p240|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_311.wav|p241|I was rubbish.
DUMMY/p231/p231_062.wav|p231|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_132.wav|p247|Which can happen any time.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_080.wav|p241|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY/p225/p225_199.wav|p225|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_198.wav|p231|It was a moment of madness.
DUMMY/p231/p231_123.wav|p231|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
DUMMY/p245/p245_140.wav|p245|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY/p247/p247_349.wav|p247|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY/p248/p248_352.wav|p248|He has seen the past.
DUMMY/p241/p241_256.wav|p241|They are real.
DUMMY/p228/p228_363.wav|p228|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY/p237/p237_322.wav|p237|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY/p226/p226_105.wav|p226|May not have been at fault?
DUMMY/p245/p245_109.wav|p245|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p229/p229_106.wav|p229|Two of the team became ill.
DUMMY/p243/p243_063.wav|p243|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY/p246/p246_032.wav|p246|He was jailed for five years.
DUMMY/p234/p234_289.wav|p234|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_003.wav|p240|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p229/p229_098.wav|p229|She's got to say something.
DUMMY/p249/p249_093.wav|p249|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY/p229/p229_333.wav|p229|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY/p243/p243_259.wav|p243|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY/p239/p239_378.wav|p239|I love the spectacle of cinema.
DUMMY/p237/p237_101.wav|p237|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p239/p239_103.wav|p239|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
DUMMY/p248/p248_196.wav|p248|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY/p241/p241_171.wav|p241|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY/p237/p237_289.wav|p237|She failed in her action.
DUMMY/p244/p244_131.wav|p244|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
DUMMY/p249/p249_049.wav|p249|I would love to have him home.
DUMMY/p234/p234_218.wav|p234|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY/p227/p227_227.wav|p227|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY/p230/p230_270.wav|p230|I was ready for this.
DUMMY/p240/p240_294.wav|p240|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY/p245/p245_123.wav|p245|Is that it?
DUMMY/p238/p238_291.wav|p238|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
DUMMY/p244/p244_284.wav|p244|It is important that he is involved.
DUMMY/p229/p229_017.wav|p229|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p230/p230_075.wav|p230|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY/p227/p227_048.wav|p227|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY/p229/p229_268.wav|p229|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY/p243/p243_172.wav|p243|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY/p247/p247_270.wav|p247|Does that put pressure on us ?)
DUMMY/p232/p232_143.wav|p232|They did very well.
DUMMY/p245/p245_096.wav|p245|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY/p245/p245_060.wav|p245|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY/p234/p234_088.wav|p234|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_001.wav|p231|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p227/p227_104.wav|p227|And the match was not too bad, either.
DUMMY/p249/p249_318.wav|p249|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY/p234/p234_249.wav|p234|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
DUMMY/p237/p237_049.wav|p237|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY/p232/p232_324.wav|p232|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY/p244/p244_193.wav|p244|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_042.wav|p240|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY/p238/p238_184.wav|p238|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY/p226/p226_172.wav|p226|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p239/p239_253.wav|p239|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
DUMMY/p244/p244_354.wav|p244|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
DUMMY/p227/p227_213.wav|p227|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_171.wav|p249|We have to move forward.
DUMMY/p247/p247_081.wav|p247|She died in hospital two hours later.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_385.wav|p238|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_314.wav|p248|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY/p247/p247_417.wav|p247|Shelter also supports the reform.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_101.wav|p226|It was mayhem.
DUMMY/p243/p243_281.wav|p243|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
DUMMY/p240/p240_229.wav|p240|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY/p226/p226_211.wav|p226|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY/p237/p237_093.wav|p237|We must look forward.
DUMMY/p247/p247_398.wav|p247|It is a simple equation.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_079.wav|p226|Neither it is.
DUMMY/p226/p226_021.wav|p226|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.

DUMMY/p237/p237_227.wav|p237|You have to do your research.
DUMMY/p232/p232_328.wav|p232|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
DUMMY/p243/p243_386.wav|p243|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_075.wav|p247|I was very pleased with them today, though.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_041.wav|p226|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY/p226/p226_018.wav|p226|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p237/p237_235.wav|p237|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY/p227/p227_114.wav|p227|But we could only help a handful of people.
DUMMY/p243/p243_256.wav|p243|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY/p245/p245_095.wav|p245|Oil embargo endorsed.
DUMMY/p240/p240_043.wav|p240|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY/p240/p240_347.wav|p240|It is so unfair.
DUMMY/p245/p245_240.wav|p245|I was shocked.
DUMMY/p228/p228_369.wav|p228|There is no signature.
DUMMY/p230/p230_361.wav|p230|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p247/p247_128.wav|p247|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_200.wav|p241|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY/p246/p246_060.wav|p246|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p227/p227_127.wav|p227|Any success would have been an improvement.
DUMMY/p246/p246_275.wav|p246|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY/p249/p249_189.wav|p249|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
DUMMY/p239/p239_150.wav|p239|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY/p230/p230_130.wav|p230|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
DUMMY/p228/p228_159.wav|p228|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY/p249/p249_051.wav|p249|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY/p231/p231_223.wav|p231|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p236/p236_486.wav|p236|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
DUMMY/p244/p244_114.wav|p244|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
DUMMY/p234/p234_146.wav|p234|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY/p228/p228_216.wav|p228|That will be vital.
DUMMY/p232/p232_219.wav|p232|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p238/p238_061.wav|p238|We work for the athlete.
DUMMY/p241/p241_003.wav|p241|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p246/p246_281.wav|p246|It's so awful.
DUMMY/p248/p248_104.wav|p248|That is no use.
DUMMY/p230/p230_148.wav|p230|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY/p245/p245_272.wav|p245|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_274.wav|p243|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
DUMMY/p245/p245_326.wav|p245|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p238/p238_199.wav|p238|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_353.wav|p246|Hartley should know.
DUMMY/p230/p230_242.wav|p230|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY/p230/p230_364.wav|p230|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY/p243/p243_126.wav|p243|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY/p240/p240_076.wav|p240|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY/p227/p227_226.wav|p227|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY/p247/p247_271.wav|p247|Did it work ?)
DUMMY/p234/p234_098.wav|p234|I cannot wait to get started on it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_209.wav|p229|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY/p243/p243_116.wav|p243|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_340.wav|p229|He did a good job.
DUMMY/p238/p238_190.wav|p238|You just have to accept.
DUMMY/p243/p243_011.wav|p243|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p229/p229_173.wav|p229|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
DUMMY/p237/p237_084.wav|p237|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY/p228/p228_349.wav|p228|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p227/p227_241.wav|p227|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p226/p226_265.wav|p226|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p241/p241_352.wav|p241|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY/p238/p238_269.wav|p238|It was a bit of a tightrope.
DUMMY/p234/p234_252.wav|p234|It was far from business as usual.
DUMMY/p239/p239_492.wav|p239|MOVIE stars are public property.
DUMMY/p243/p243_347.wav|p243|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
DUMMY/p244/p244_033.wav|p244|It is on the internet.
DUMMY/p240/p240_314.wav|p240|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY/p231/p231_249.wav|p231|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY/p246/p246_296.wav|p246|We are not going to forget.
DUMMY/p238/p238_243.wav|p238|It is crucial for both teams.
DUMMY/p244/p244_421.wav|p244|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
DUMMY/p236/p236_378.wav|p236|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY/p232/p232_246.wav|p232|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY/p243/p243_273.wav|p243|I think I was about four years old.
DUMMY/p237/p237_121.wav|p237|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY/p247/p247_275.wav|p247|What form did that take ?)
DUMMY/p231/p231_398.wav|p231|They have failed to deliver.
DUMMY/p238/p238_039.wav|p238|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY/p240/p240_164.wav|p240|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY/p232/p232_120.wav|p232|It is rubbish.
DUMMY/p243/p243_082.wav|p243|It's been a great evening for us.
DUMMY/p238/p238_369.wav|p238|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY/p238/p238_250.wav|p238|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY/p245/p245_089.wav|p245|If you could find it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_371.wav|p244|I have a good feeling about this.
DUMMY/p229/p229_144.wav|p229|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p228/p228_057.wav|p228|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY/p237/p237_222.wav|p237|By hard work, is the answer.
DUMMY/p241/p241_058.wav|p241|I was an athlete.
DUMMY/p234/p234_175.wav|p234|They have not been named.
DUMMY/p230/p230_057.wav|p230|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY/p234/p234_157.wav|p234|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
DUMMY/p232/p232_296.wav|p232|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY/p244/p244_056.wav|p244|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY/p236/p236_283.wav|p236|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY/p225/p225_346.wav|p225|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
DUMMY/p225/p225_175.wav|p225|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY/p234/p234_093.wav|p234|He is in the US.
DUMMY/p248/p248_036.wav|p248|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p234/p234_298.wav|p234|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY/p245/p245_339.wav|p245|I would miss him.
DUMMY/p247/p247_131.wav|p247|They keep the atmosphere in mind.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_095.wav|p234|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p226/p226_248.wav|p226|I was shocked.
DUMMY/p245/p245_231.wav|p245|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY/p244/p244_379.wav|p244|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY/p225/p225_040.wav|p225|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY/p226/p226_345.wav|p226|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY/p237/p237_096.wav|p237|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY/p245/p245_077.wav|p245|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY/p232/p232_338.wav|p232|The team for the first game could be this one.
DUMMY/p246/p246_240.wav|p246|It is hard won.
DUMMY/p236/p236_482.wav|p236|Winning a medal is a dream.
DUMMY/p240/p240_195.wav|p240|I am totally surprised.
DUMMY/p245/p245_014.wav|p245|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p245/p245_210.wav|p245|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY/p249/p249_090.wav|p249|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY/p245/p245_135.wav|p245|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
DUMMY/p238/p238_329.wav|p238|Golf is not like that.
DUMMY/p236/p236_483.wav|p236|We had to add value.
DUMMY/p243/p243_279.wav|p243|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
DUMMY/p228/p228_223.wav|p228|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY/p230/p230_001.wav|p230|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p239/p239_476.wav|p239|Banking stocks were hit hard.
DUMMY/p237/p237_228.wav|p237|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY/p232/p232_384.wav|p232|There is no signature.
DUMMY/p246/p246_074.wav|p246|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p229/p229_044.wav|p229|I was scared.
DUMMY/p237/p237_135.wav|p237|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY/p230/p230_054.wav|p230|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY/p240/p240_303.wav|p240|He said she was mad.
DUMMY/p239/p239_118.wav|p239|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY/p229/p229_351.wav|p229|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY/p246/p246_170.wav|p246|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p239/p239_499.wav|p239|I am not unduly surprised.
DUMMY/p244/p244_084.wav|p244|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_045.wav|p234|All businesses continue to trade.
DUMMY/p239/p239_284.wav|p239|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY/p225/p225_299.wav|p225|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
DUMMY/p246/p246_013.wav|p246|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p236/p236_311.wav|p236|We can work all night.
DUMMY/p244/p244_104.wav|p244|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_255.wav|p236|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
DUMMY/p236/p236_406.wav|p236|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY/p247/p247_433.wav|p247|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_417.wav|p239|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY/p230/p230_330.wav|p230|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY/p246/p246_050.wav|p246|She looked so young.
DUMMY/p244/p244_016.wav|p244|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p236/p236_079.wav|p236|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY/p248/p248_221.wav|p248|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
DUMMY/p239/p239_093.wav|p239|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
DUMMY/p245/p245_151.wav|p245|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY/p234/p234_292.wav|p234|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY/p248/p248_192.wav|p248|All options are open.
DUMMY/p230/p230_100.wav|p230|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY/p227/p227_073.wav|p227|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY/p230/p230_287.wav|p230|You get a lot for your money.
DUMMY/p247/p247_072.wav|p247|You should try to have a laugh.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_243.wav|p246|The scene is about this?
DUMMY/p249/p249_052.wav|p249|It will come all right.
DUMMY/p236/p236_077.wav|p236|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p230/p230_374.wav|p230|She is now on the back benches.
DUMMY/p236/p236_019.wav|p236|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p232/p232_250.wav|p232|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY/p249/p249_265.wav|p249|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY/p240/p240_237.wav|p240|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY/p240/p240_143.wav|p240|She died at her home.
DUMMY/p249/p249_160.wav|p249|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY/p239/p239_208.wav|p239|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY/p246/p246_268.wav|p246|We are happy.
DUMMY/p230/p230_114.wav|p230|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY/p231/p231_458.wav|p231|She has reached the top of her profession.
DUMMY/p248/p248_187.wav|p248|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY/p230/p230_199.wav|p230|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY/p227/p227_039.wav|p227|Among them are many criminals.
DUMMY/p247/p247_255.wav|p247|Mr Smith declined to comment.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_148.wav|p234|It is expected to last a week.
DUMMY/p230/p230_385.wav|p230|If you can get it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_157.wav|p238|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY/p248/p248_101.wav|p248|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY/p230/p230_225.wav|p230|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
DUMMY/p237/p237_165.wav|p237|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY/p245/p245_090.wav|p245|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY/p237/p237_111.wav|p237|It's in his blood.
DUMMY/p239/p239_195.wav|p239|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY/p234/p234_018.wav|p234|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p245/p245_013.wav|p245|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p243/p243_073.wav|p243|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
DUMMY/p231/p231_454.wav|p231|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
DUMMY/p234/p234_301.wav|p234|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY/p248/p248_116.wav|p248|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY/p245/p245_070.wav|p245|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY/p238/p238_403.wav|p238|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY/p248/p248_234.wav|p248|They should come forward.
DUMMY/p228/p228_313.wav|p228|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY/p237/p237_259.wav|p237|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY/p231/p231_016.wav|p231|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p227/p227_006.wav|p227|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p241/p241_353.wav|p241|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p245/p245_141.wav|p245|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY/p244/p244_043.wav|p244|Something has to be put in place.
DUMMY/p239/p239_432.wav|p239|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY/p238/p238_224.wav|p238|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY/p228/p228_006.wav|p228|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_310.wav|p243|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY/p247/p247_130.wav|p247|We suffered a lot for seven years.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_016.wav|p245|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p239/p239_385.wav|p239|Those overseas offices were great.
DUMMY/p234/p234_347.wav|p234|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
DUMMY/p227/p227_117.wav|p227|This should begin in October.
DUMMY/p228/p228_033.wav|p228|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY/p234/p234_109.wav|p234|It is not affected by the sale.
DUMMY/p237/p237_265.wav|p237|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY/p249/p249_058.wav|p249|It is unique.
DUMMY/p244/p244_197.wav|p244|That you can do it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_300.wav|p241|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY/p228/p228_158.wav|p228|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p236/p236_366.wav|p236|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY/p232/p232_105.wav|p232|That is no use.
DUMMY/p238/p238_062.wav|p238|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p226/p226_224.wav|p226|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p226/p226_274.wav|p226|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY/p232/p232_108.wav|p232|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY/p244/p244_049.wav|p244|That is still the case.
DUMMY/p239/p239_101.wav|p239|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY/p243/p243_164.wav|p243|Surely it can't run for two years.
DUMMY/p236/p236_305.wav|p236|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY/p248/p248_200.wav|p248|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY/p231/p231_319.wav|p231|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p240/p240_362.wav|p240|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY/p245/p245_186.wav|p245|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY/p229/p229_348.wav|p229|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY/p226/p226_056.wav|p226|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p228/p228_102.wav|p228|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
DUMMY/p240/p240_205.wav|p240|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p230/p230_306.wav|p230|Rugby is now just like football.
DUMMY/p227/p227_066.wav|p227|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
DUMMY/p236/p236_196.wav|p236|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY/p234/p234_340.wav|p234|That is always a problem.
DUMMY/p236/p236_312.wav|p236|It was really very frightening.
DUMMY/p232/p232_405.wav|p232|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY/p230/p230_329.wav|p230|We are on a four-year mission.
DUMMY/p249/p249_147.wav|p249|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p231/p231_396.wav|p231|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY/p246/p246_058.wav|p246|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY/p236/p236_006.wav|p236|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_392.wav|p244|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_139.wav|p243|The programme has been made with great care.
DUMMY/p238/p238_164.wav|p238|Yet the survey has been cautious.
DUMMY/p230/p230_308.wav|p230|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY/p239/p239_452.wav|p239|We didn't want any trouble.
DUMMY/p225/p225_208.wav|p225|You are a great player.
DUMMY/p229/p229_045.wav|p229|It will come all right.
DUMMY/p236/p236_369.wav|p236|We are a Scottish company.
DUMMY/p247/p247_336.wav|p247|Then followed a bout of flu.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_062.wav|p240|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY/p240/p240_173.wav|p240|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p229/p229_112.wav|p229|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
DUMMY/p234/p234_187.wav|p234|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY/p225/p225_237.wav|p225|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
DUMMY/p232/p232_354.wav|p232|It is long gone.
DUMMY/p239/p239_328.wav|p239|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY/p241/p241_023.wav|p241|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p229/p229_350.wav|p229|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY/p249/p249_062.wav|p249|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p228/p228_116.wav|p228|However, they will only be found in the wild.
DUMMY/p230/p230_351.wav|p230|He is not very big, either.
DUMMY/p248/p248_029.wav|p248|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
DUMMY/p240/p240_181.wav|p240|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY/p248/p248_105.wav|p248|That all hope is never lost.
DUMMY/p245/p245_220.wav|p245|They had no children.
DUMMY/p240/p240_231.wav|p240|They are the innocent victims.
DUMMY/p244/p244_186.wav|p244|The feeling is hard to describe.
DUMMY/p229/p229_254.wav|p229|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p241/p241_365.wav|p241|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY/p243/p243_349.wav|p243|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
DUMMY/p243/p243_326.wav|p243|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
DUMMY/p234/p234_288.wav|p234|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_210.wav|p227|This is a holy place.
DUMMY/p244/p244_004.wav|p244|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p248/p248_115.wav|p248|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY/p239/p239_431.wav|p239|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p247/p247_054.wav|p247|Italy is a beautiful place.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_167.wav|p237|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY/p241/p241_350.wav|p241|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY/p227/p227_316.wav|p227|This is a big step up.
DUMMY/p249/p249_042.wav|p249|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY/p238/p238_383.wav|p238|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_047.wav|p248|It is urgent.
DUMMY/p232/p232_221.wav|p232|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY/p246/p246_102.wav|p246|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
DUMMY/p247/p247_246.wav|p247|Half of young people had had contact with the police.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_097.wav|p240|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
DUMMY/p244/p244_040.wav|p244|She was at the top.
DUMMY/p246/p246_075.wav|p246|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY/p241/p241_207.wav|p241|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY/p243/p243_094.wav|p243|There is no issue of national security involved here.
DUMMY/p247/p247_242.wav|p247|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_082.wav|p245|It's never too late.
DUMMY/p228/p228_193.wav|p228|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY/p226/p226_352.wav|p226|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_366.wav|p241|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY/p239/p239_149.wav|p239|I was given no instructions by no-one.
DUMMY/p234/p234_307.wav|p234|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY/p230/p230_048.wav|p230|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY/p245/p245_301.wav|p245|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
DUMMY/p246/p246_150.wav|p246|I was stunned.
DUMMY/p231/p231_429.wav|p231|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY/p241/p241_033.wav|p241|People love to see this stuff.
DUMMY/p245/p245_280.wav|p245|Well, he can do it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_093.wav|p245|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY/p249/p249_224.wav|p249|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
DUMMY/p230/p230_036.wav|p230|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p234/p234_097.wav|p234|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
DUMMY/p240/p240_132.wav|p240|It was the same at Twickenham.
DUMMY/p227/p227_167.wav|p227|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_303.wav|p230|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY/p228/p228_275.wav|p228|They were too hard.
DUMMY/p241/p241_175.wav|p241|And I saw the light!
DUMMY/p246/p246_204.wav|p246|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY/p236/p236_128.wav|p236|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY/p240/p240_033.wav|p240|This is the window.
DUMMY/p229/p229_143.wav|p229|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
DUMMY/p232/p232_251.wav|p232|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
DUMMY/p248/p248_368.wav|p248|Five members were disciplined.
DUMMY/p239/p239_198.wav|p239|He said the director had been completely friendly.
DUMMY/p249/p249_284.wav|p249|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY/p228/p228_271.wav|p228|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p230/p230_034.wav|p230|He really is a lovely man.
DUMMY/p247/p247_102.wav|p247|But it is up again.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_099.wav|p230|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY/p230/p230_105.wav|p230|It is close to call.
DUMMY/p234/p234_140.wav|p234|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY/p225/p225_279.wav|p225|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p237/p237_278.wav|p237|The warning is timely.
DUMMY/p228/p228_358.wav|p228|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY/p245/p245_295.wav|p245|Nothing is safe.
DUMMY/p246/p246_266.wav|p246|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY/p240/p240_017.wav|p240|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p229/p229_219.wav|p229|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY/p234/p234_183.wav|p234|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p240/p240_238.wav|p240|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY/p244/p244_272.wav|p244|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_223.wav|p229|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY/p232/p232_403.wav|p232|My house was shaking at the time.
DUMMY/p244/p244_255.wav|p244|A lot has been written.
DUMMY/p230/p230_157.wav|p230|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY/p236/p236_261.wav|p236|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY/p230/p230_101.wav|p230|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p247/p247_290.wav|p247|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_016.wav|p240|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p247/p247_097.wav|p247|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_150.wav|p243|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_135.wav|p228|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
DUMMY/p239/p239_005.wav|p239|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p234/p234_203.wav|p234|We can take the city.
DUMMY/p232/p232_326.wav|p232|It's not long enough.
DUMMY/p243/p243_248.wav|p243|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
DUMMY/p239/p239_051.wav|p239|New York is my home.
DUMMY/p238/p238_156.wav|p238|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY/p239/p239_053.wav|p239|I remember that day well.
DUMMY/p248/p248_323.wav|p248|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p243/p243_174.wav|p243|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
DUMMY/p225/p225_273.wav|p225|He has not created a Festival resource.
DUMMY/p227/p227_390.wav|p227|Celtic were pleased to help.
DUMMY/p232/p232_352.wav|p232|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY/p245/p245_317.wav|p245|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY/p249/p249_038.wav|p249|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY/p227/p227_012.wav|p227|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p248/p248_043.wav|p248|It was ugly.
DUMMY/p247/p247_172.wav|p247|It was by the numbers.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_078.wav|p228|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
DUMMY/p238/p238_201.wav|p238|Did it work ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_013.wav|p225|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p245/p245_265.wav|p245|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY/p226/p226_276.wav|p226|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p236/p236_109.wav|p236|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY/p232/p232_127.wav|p232|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY/p249/p249_262.wav|p249|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY/p228/p228_284.wav|p228|It changed my life.
DUMMY/p228/p228_121.wav|p228|The picture is the same across Scotland.
DUMMY/p239/p239_260.wav|p239|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
DUMMY/p244/p244_303.wav|p244|We have to be realistic.
DUMMY/p232/p232_054.wav|p232|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
DUMMY/p243/p243_048.wav|p243|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_103.wav|p248|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY/p232/p232_156.wav|p232|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY/p241/p241_019.wav|p241|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p241/p241_104.wav|p241|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY/p240/p240_060.wav|p240|That's the truth.
DUMMY/p231/p231_423.wav|p231|It was important to win the singles.
DUMMY/p230/p230_032.wav|p230|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p229/p229_041.wav|p229|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY/p239/p239_230.wav|p239|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY/p231/p231_130.wav|p231|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY/p236/p236_356.wav|p236|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_349.wav|p245|It is not like working for a living.
DUMMY/p228/p228_339.wav|p228|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
DUMMY/p234/p234_266.wav|p234|Not in this production he doesn't.
DUMMY/p238/p238_272.wav|p238|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY/p225/p225_350.wav|p225|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_218.wav|p248|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p231/p231_087.wav|p231|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY/p237/p237_187.wav|p237|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p240/p240_352.wav|p240|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY/p247/p247_479.wav|p247|That was the first time I worked with Richard.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_235.wav|p232|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY/p238/p238_057.wav|p238|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_038.wav|p229|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY/p239/p239_411.wav|p239|You can feel at home in China.
DUMMY/p237/p237_127.wav|p237|I'm so angry.
DUMMY/p249/p249_209.wav|p249|I have a cold.
DUMMY/p225/p225_083.wav|p225|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY/p238/p238_415.wav|p238|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY/p227/p227_280.wav|p227|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p247/p247_249.wav|p247|Others agreed with this view.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_293.wav|p245|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY/p237/p237_117.wav|p237|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY/p231/p231_052.wav|p231|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY/p230/p230_008.wav|p230|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p230/p230_319.wav|p230|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY/p232/p232_147.wav|p232|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p247/p247_357.wav|p247|It was tough to contain the excitement.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_022.wav|p248|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p236/p236_389.wav|p236|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_320.wav|p227|In that case, the children were not missing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_154.wav|p239|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
DUMMY/p230/p230_373.wav|p230|It's going to be fun.
DUMMY/p241/p241_364.wav|p241|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
DUMMY/p231/p231_397.wav|p231|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
DUMMY/p226/p226_015.wav|p226|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p236/p236_173.wav|p236|They could not match it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_093.wav|p231|We must stop it with the golf ball.
DUMMY/p249/p249_237.wav|p249|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY/p225/p225_113.wav|p225|The big issue for us is the review.
DUMMY/p228/p228_037.wav|p228|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY/p239/p239_468.wav|p239|The money is within the total allocation.
DUMMY/p244/p244_279.wav|p244|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY/p237/p237_175.wav|p237|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY/p231/p231_085.wav|p231|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p238/p238_040.wav|p238|I remember that day well.
DUMMY/p229/p229_283.wav|p229|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY/p248/p248_113.wav|p248|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY/p246/p246_318.wav|p246|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_306.wav|p227|It is an amazing response.
DUMMY/p246/p246_267.wav|p246|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p249/p249_340.wav|p249|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY/p234/p234_008.wav|p234|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p240/p240_342.wav|p240|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p225/p225_182.wav|p225|We are just glad to be alive.
DUMMY/p239/p239_389.wav|p239|A new school will be built.
DUMMY/p248/p248_083.wav|p248|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
DUMMY/p238/p238_066.wav|p238|It's the performance we want.
DUMMY/p241/p241_055.wav|p241|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY/p236/p236_116.wav|p236|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
DUMMY/p237/p237_108.wav|p237|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY/p245/p245_027.wav|p245|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_184.wav|p236|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY/p240/p240_261.wav|p240|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY/p236/p236_064.wav|p236|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p240/p240_186.wav|p240|They really did a great job.
DUMMY/p234/p234_268.wav|p234|Then was the summer of their discontent.
DUMMY/p229/p229_050.wav|p229|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p232/p232_399.wav|p232|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY/p227/p227_293.wav|p227|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY/p239/p239_416.wav|p239|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY/p247/p247_198.wav|p247|It caused a lot of upset.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_256.wav|p248|they fail to engage.
DUMMY/p231/p231_377.wav|p231|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY/p240/p240_111.wav|p240|It's a question of perception.
DUMMY/p245/p245_105.wav|p245|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY/p234/p234_171.wav|p234|Much of the equipment was new.
DUMMY/p229/p229_210.wav|p229|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY/p236/p236_326.wav|p236|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY/p232/p232_170.wav|p232|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY/p239/p239_264.wav|p239|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
DUMMY/p228/p228_046.wav|p228|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p227/p227_389.wav|p227|In due course the deal was done.
DUMMY/p231/p231_238.wav|p231|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY/p231/p231_056.wav|p231|Italy is a beautiful place.
DUMMY/p230/p230_272.wav|p230|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY/p243/p243_108.wav|p243|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY/p240/p240_309.wav|p240|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY/p231/p231_018.wav|p231|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p248/p248_285.wav|p248|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY/p237/p237_028.wav|p237|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY/p240/p240_198.wav|p240|There was no option.
DUMMY/p248/p248_071.wav|p248|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY/p227/p227_029.wav|p227|This is a central issue.
DUMMY/p229/p229_046.wav|p229|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY/p226/p226_124.wav|p226|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY/p246/p246_048.wav|p246|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY/p229/p229_092.wav|p229|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY/p238/p238_242.wav|p238|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p234/p234_244.wav|p234|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_277.wav|p247|He is quite well organised.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_458.wav|p239|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY/p246/p246_257.wav|p246|I could have got out a long time ago.
DUMMY/p231/p231_098.wav|p231|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY/p236/p236_361.wav|p236|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY/p226/p226_312.wav|p226|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
DUMMY/p238/p238_405.wav|p238|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY/p236/p236_045.wav|p236|We are working on it.
DUMMY/p234/p234_231.wav|p234|He is a good friend.
DUMMY/p241/p241_232.wav|p241|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY/p234/p234_202.wav|p234|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_278.wav|p240|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
DUMMY/p239/p239_393.wav|p239|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_271.wav|p227|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p239/p239_170.wav|p239|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY/p240/p240_162.wav|p240|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p230/p230_241.wav|p230|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY/p241/p241_120.wav|p241|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p248/p248_156.wav|p248|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY/p241/p241_319.wav|p241|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
DUMMY/p246/p246_166.wav|p246|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY/p244/p244_191.wav|p244|It is simply not true.
DUMMY/p239/p239_267.wav|p239|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
DUMMY/p240/p240_220.wav|p240|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p228/p228_125.wav|p228|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p237/p237_006.wav|p237|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_414.wav|p244|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
DUMMY/p247/p247_207.wav|p247|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_407.wav|p239|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
DUMMY/p234/p234_272.wav|p234|We want this place to work.
DUMMY/p249/p249_269.wav|p249|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY/p248/p248_079.wav|p248|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY/p227/p227_347.wav|p227|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY/p247/p247_029.wav|p247|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_258.wav|p234|I am delighted for them.
DUMMY/p236/p236_291.wav|p236|My body is a wreck.
DUMMY/p236/p236_244.wav|p236|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p241/p241_290.wav|p241|A new school will be built.
DUMMY/p228/p228_241.wav|p228|It's only fair.
DUMMY/p227/p227_326.wav|p227|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY/p237/p237_218.wav|p237|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_016.wav|p249|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p232/p232_259.wav|p232|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY/p247/p247_017.wav|p247|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
DUMMY/p249/p249_288.wav|p249|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY/p239/p239_404.wav|p239|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
DUMMY/p227/p227_070.wav|p227|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p248/p248_021.wav|p248|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p244/p244_041.wav|p244|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY/p245/p245_131.wav|p245|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY/p228/p228_251.wav|p228|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY/p238/p238_345.wav|p238|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY/p239/p239_324.wav|p239|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_152.wav|p238|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
DUMMY/p227/p227_164.wav|p227|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY/p232/p232_100.wav|p232|It was mayhem.
DUMMY/p232/p232_004.wav|p232|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p245/p245_148.wav|p245|That will do for me.
DUMMY/p244/p244_032.wav|p244|The end result is the same.
DUMMY/p228/p228_255.wav|p228|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY/p227/p227_244.wav|p227|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p234/p234_176.wav|p234|I was in a hole.
DUMMY/p246/p246_002.wav|p246|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p245/p245_206.wav|p245|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY/p231/p231_066.wav|p231|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p236/p236_343.wav|p236|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p227/p227_215.wav|p227|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_351.wav|p247|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_216.wav|p230|He has made his base in Spain.
DUMMY/p244/p244_208.wav|p244|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY/p237/p237_215.wav|p237|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
DUMMY/p226/p226_235.wav|p226|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY/p232/p232_038.wav|p232|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY/p225/p225_257.wav|p225|My son was too young to die.
DUMMY/p248/p248_100.wav|p248|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY/p230/p230_389.wav|p230|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY/p237/p237_078.wav|p237|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY/p247/p247_342.wav|p247|It is inherent in society.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_053.wav|p249|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY/p240/p240_326.wav|p240|It is out there.
DUMMY/p246/p246_307.wav|p246|The plot is minimal.
DUMMY/p247/p247_194.wav|p247|They were seriously after him.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_142.wav|p240|Who would be right?
DUMMY/p234/p234_090.wav|p234|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_299.wav|p237|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p231/p231_010.wav|p231|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_281.wav|p238|First, the programme was unbalanced.
DUMMY/p236/p236_349.wav|p236|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY/p229/p229_052.wav|p229|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY/p247/p247_414.wav|p247|After the match, do you ?)
DUMMY/p247/p247_209.wav|p247|It was worth a photograph.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_005.wav|p238|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p239/p239_429.wav|p239|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
DUMMY/p237/p237_342.wav|p237|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY/p236/p236_021.wav|p236|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p249/p249_326.wav|p249|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p239/p239_474.wav|p239|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p230/p230_084.wav|p230|You are a great player.
DUMMY/p236/p236_086.wav|p236|It was a big departure.
DUMMY/p246/p246_321.wav|p246|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY/p248/p248_209.wav|p248|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
DUMMY/p236/p236_382.wav|p236|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
DUMMY/p247/p247_280.wav|p247|Scotland won by six wickets.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_265.wav|p234|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY/p240/p240_063.wav|p240|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY/p226/p226_004.wav|p226|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p226/p226_304.wav|p226|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p246/p246_110.wav|p246|It is so sad.
DUMMY/p238/p238_094.wav|p238|There can be no compromise on welfare.
DUMMY/p227/p227_059.wav|p227|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_060.wav|p244|We have got to deliver.
DUMMY/p247/p247_272.wav|p247|Do you think we are a top nation ?)
DUMMY/p240/p240_138.wav|p240|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY/p248/p248_146.wav|p248|This film will be totally awesome.
DUMMY/p241/p241_298.wav|p241|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p232/p232_029.wav|p232|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY/p227/p227_367.wav|p227|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_293.wav|p231|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY/p246/p246_340.wav|p246|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY/p248/p248_313.wav|p248|Off with their heads.
DUMMY/p228/p228_170.wav|p228|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p226/p226_329.wav|p226|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY/p237/p237_024.wav|p237|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p236/p236_051.wav|p236|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
DUMMY/p227/p227_135.wav|p227|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY/p239/p239_419.wav|p239|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY/p241/p241_325.wav|p241|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
DUMMY/p247/p247_228.wav|p247|The transaction is not feasible.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_319.wav|p228|Is that an issue ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_293.wav|p249|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY/p239/p239_027.wav|p239|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY/p245/p245_136.wav|p245|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p232/p232_107.wav|p232|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY/p234/p234_323.wav|p234|And he's the real thing.
DUMMY/p248/p248_177.wav|p248|And I saw the light!
DUMMY/p226/p226_369.wav|p226|He took over our lives.
DUMMY/p241/p241_277.wav|p241|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY/p244/p244_287.wav|p244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p231/p231_166.wav|p231|You've been a great audience.
DUMMY/p236/p236_210.wav|p236|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY/p238/p238_442.wav|p238|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
DUMMY/p243/p243_163.wav|p243|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
DUMMY/p245/p245_033.wav|p245|I was an athlete.
DUMMY/p246/p246_247.wav|p246|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p226/p226_218.wav|p226|I was so nervous.
DUMMY/p241/p241_001.wav|p241|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p247/p247_043.wav|p247|Among them are many criminals.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_034.wav|p227|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY/p238/p238_382.wav|p238|He did not say that.
DUMMY/p243/p243_049.wav|p243|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_360.wav|p228|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY/p247/p247_093.wav|p247|On Saturday, it was much the same.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_020.wav|p245|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_192.wav|p237|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p225/p225_005.wav|p225|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p234/p234_013.wav|p234|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p246/p246_203.wav|p246|He knows a lot.
DUMMY/p245/p245_216.wav|p245|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY/p239/p239_115.wav|p239|The partners are looking for answers.
DUMMY/p245/p245_343.wav|p245|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY/p236/p236_470.wav|p236|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY/p243/p243_320.wav|p243|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
DUMMY/p226/p226_187.wav|p226|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY/p249/p249_047.wav|p249|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p237/p237_332.wav|p237|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY/p244/p244_057.wav|p244|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY/p237/p237_310.wav|p237|This is a war over our home.
DUMMY/p243/p243_296.wav|p243|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY/p247/p247_202.wav|p247|Mr Blair was ready for him.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_202.wav|p239|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
DUMMY/p229/p229_020.wav|p229|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_347.wav|p249|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY/p247/p247_463.wav|p247|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_421.wav|p236|He will be judged by his actions.
DUMMY/p226/p226_144.wav|p226|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
DUMMY/p231/p231_195.wav|p231|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p244/p244_334.wav|p244|Tax is a matter for national governments.
DUMMY/p236/p236_346.wav|p236|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY/p231/p231_180.wav|p231|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY/p244/p244_199.wav|p244|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p249/p249_286.wav|p249|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY/p248/p248_237.wav|p248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY/p229/p229_239.wav|p229|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
DUMMY/p229/p229_122.wav|p229|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY/p241/p241_342.wav|p241|I would miss him.
DUMMY/p238/p238_148.wav|p238|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
DUMMY/p228/p228_051.wav|p228|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
DUMMY/p228/p228_161.wav|p228|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p234/p234_166.wav|p234|At the moment we do not understand it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_069.wav|p231|We need to increase the membership.
DUMMY/p236/p236_096.wav|p236|He refused to name the survivors.
DUMMY/p227/p227_146.wav|p227|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY/p244/p244_327.wav|p244|He is already in place.
DUMMY/p243/p243_178.wav|p243|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY/p228/p228_073.wav|p228|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_138.wav|p243|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
DUMMY/p225/p225_366.wav|p225|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
DUMMY/p244/p244_025.wav|p244|We are a service industry.
DUMMY/p230/p230_020.wav|p230|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p225/p225_081.wav|p225|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY/p239/p239_186.wav|p239|That was just one night.
DUMMY/p248/p248_373.wav|p248|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
DUMMY/p248/p248_208.wav|p248|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY/p241/p241_188.wav|p241|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY/p231/p231_067.wav|p231|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY/p248/p248_165.wav|p248|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY/p240/p240_091.wav|p240|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_469.wav|p247|Now that business is banned.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_112.wav|p232|You had better believe it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_375.wav|p227|It is a stroke of genius.
DUMMY/p230/p230_155.wav|p230|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY/p237/p237_164.wav|p237|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY/p238/p238_045.wav|p238|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_137.wav|p247|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_080.wav|p229|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY/p244/p244_226.wav|p244|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY/p247/p247_035.wav|p247|That is the face of fear.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_008.wav|p241|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p232/p232_363.wav|p232|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY/p227/p227_128.wav|p227|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p238/p238_276.wav|p238|They could not match it.
DUMMY/p243/p243_233.wav|p243|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
DUMMY/p229/p229_153.wav|p229|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY/p237/p237_341.wav|p237|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY/p232/p232_270.wav|p232|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p236/p236_175.wav|p236|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_212.wav|p237|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_171.wav|p225|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
DUMMY/p244/p244_319.wav|p244|Look at the potential of this club.
DUMMY/p245/p245_313.wav|p245|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY/p248/p248_163.wav|p248|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY/p232/p232_226.wav|p232|Mental health is a massive issue.
DUMMY/p236/p236_252.wav|p236|It's important to get it right.
DUMMY/p243/p243_024.wav|p243|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p227/p227_072.wav|p227|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
DUMMY/p237/p237_181.wav|p237|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
DUMMY/p246/p246_173.wav|p246|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p249/p249_139.wav|p249|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY/p237/p237_040.wav|p237|It's a great thing.
DUMMY/p232/p232_130.wav|p232|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY/p238/p238_388.wav|p238|His successor was only appointed last month.
DUMMY/p247/p247_456.wav|p247|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_171.wav|p248|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY/p237/p237_025.wav|p237|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY/p238/p238_187.wav|p238|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY/p234/p234_032.wav|p234|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY/p237/p237_023.wav|p237|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_285.wav|p238|But I was glad to see these interviews.
DUMMY/p232/p232_286.wav|p232|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY/p232/p232_161.wav|p232|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
DUMMY/p236/p236_313.wav|p236|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY/p243/p243_140.wav|p243|There was only one living room, you see.
DUMMY/p225/p225_242.wav|p225|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY/p238/p238_450.wav|p238|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY/p228/p228_270.wav|p228|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY/p241/p241_126.wav|p241|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY/p238/p238_455.wav|p238|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY/p248/p248_033.wav|p248|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY/p241/p241_098.wav|p241|I love the Dome.
DUMMY/p226/p226_091.wav|p226|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p247/p247_435.wav|p247|It's going to be epic.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_118.wav|p236|Three hours later, the man was free.
DUMMY/p227/p227_318.wav|p227|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p244/p244_155.wav|p244|It was all for good reason as well.
DUMMY/p234/p234_042.wav|p234|He was in his element.
DUMMY/p245/p245_168.wav|p245|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY/p237/p237_134.wav|p237|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY/p246/p246_126.wav|p246|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
DUMMY/p247/p247_074.wav|p247|It wasn't possible to relax.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_465.wav|p239|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
DUMMY/p231/p231_101.wav|p231|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY/p248/p248_179.wav|p248|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY/p230/p230_243.wav|p230|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY/p247/p247_146.wav|p247|This represents a tough game for us.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_350.wav|p236|A great deal has been achieved.
DUMMY/p225/p225_193.wav|p225|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY/p243/p243_101.wav|p243|We are already seeing some positive results.
DUMMY/p236/p236_166.wav|p236|He is not a team captain.
DUMMY/p246/p246_202.wav|p246|Feel the heat?
DUMMY/p228/p228_181.wav|p228|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p249/p249_220.wav|p249|Feel the heat?
DUMMY/p227/p227_400.wav|p227|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_140.wav|p248|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY/p228/p228_218.wav|p228|That is an important part of our role.
DUMMY/p243/p243_120.wav|p243|It is the right package for Scotland.
DUMMY/p249/p249_021.wav|p249|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p237/p237_276.wav|p237|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p243/p243_290.wav|p243|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
DUMMY/p239/p239_015.wav|p239|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p232/p232_372.wav|p232|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY/p234/p234_039.wav|p234|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY/p231/p231_314.wav|p231|I'm not making any comment at all.
DUMMY/p246/p246_310.wav|p246|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY/p246/p246_112.wav|p246|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
DUMMY/p228/p228_221.wav|p228|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p236/p236_391.wav|p236|The following day I used the story.
DUMMY/p244/p244_099.wav|p244|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p240/p240_283.wav|p240|People have no choice.
DUMMY/p232/p232_276.wav|p232|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY/p247/p247_065.wav|p247|We will pay their bills.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_274.wav|p246|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY/p243/p243_267.wav|p243|The board do not own the company.
DUMMY/p226/p226_045.wav|p226|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p228/p228_192.wav|p228|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY/p227/p227_358.wav|p227|Of course, we want to go home.
DUMMY/p232/p232_040.wav|p232|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY/p231/p231_239.wav|p231|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY/p237/p237_001.wav|p237|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p236/p236_383.wav|p236|A review is under way.
DUMMY/p237/p237_057.wav|p237|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY/p236/p236_083.wav|p236|The Queen Mother is dead.
DUMMY/p226/p226_023.wav|p226|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p230/p230_201.wav|p230|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY/p239/p239_345.wav|p239|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY/p247/p247_063.wav|p247|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
DUMMY/p243/p243_142.wav|p243|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY/p234/p234_012.wav|p234|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p238/p238_435.wav|p238|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY/p232/p232_118.wav|p232|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p227/p227_091.wav|p227|That is the important thing.
DUMMY/p247/p247_014.wav|p247|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
DUMMY/p237/p237_009.wav|p237|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p237/p237_018.wav|p237|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p240/p240_232.wav|p240|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY/p239/p239_375.wav|p239|This should come as no surprise.
DUMMY/p246/p246_024.wav|p246|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_204.wav|p237|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY/p240/p240_340.wav|p240|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_171.wav|p237|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p244/p244_397.wav|p244|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
DUMMY/p248/p248_328.wav|p248|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
DUMMY/p240/p240_218.wav|p240|Work has started.
DUMMY/p243/p243_211.wav|p243|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY/p230/p230_251.wav|p230|They showed a lot of heart.
DUMMY/p232/p232_381.wav|p232|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY/p227/p227_145.wav|p227|These men are a part of India.
DUMMY/p240/p240_206.wav|p240|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY/p240/p240_053.wav|p240|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
DUMMY/p231/p231_421.wav|p231|There is a solution, she believes.
DUMMY/p230/p230_253.wav|p230|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY/p243/p243_389.wav|p243|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY/p238/p238_400.wav|p238|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
DUMMY/p237/p237_168.wav|p237|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_124.wav|p227|And does it ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_352.wav|p229|Everything was an effort.
DUMMY/p225/p225_003.wav|p225|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p229/p229_021.wav|p229|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p237/p237_199.wav|p237|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
DUMMY/p234/p234_334.wav|p234|We have to be very, very careful.
DUMMY/p240/p240_251.wav|p240|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY/p226/p226_205.wav|p226|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p232/p232_315.wav|p232|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p232/p232_190.wav|p232|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY/p231/p231_281.wav|p231|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY/p228/p228_075.wav|p228|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY/p230/p230_138.wav|p230|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY/p231/p231_192.wav|p231|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p236/p236_412.wav|p236|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY/p234/p234_006.wav|p234|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p229/p229_185.wav|p229|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p225/p225_287.wav|p225|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
DUMMY/p227/p227_001.wav|p227|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p231/p231_433.wav|p231|It is based on a true story.
DUMMY/p227/p227_015.wav|p227|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p244/p244_116.wav|p244|In the end we have to take a stand.
DUMMY/p238/p238_092.wav|p238|Final proposals will be published in February.
DUMMY/p245/p245_054.wav|p245|They had to explain it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_223.wav|p245|They should come forward.
DUMMY/p246/p246_111.wav|p246|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY/p236/p236_262.wav|p236|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
DUMMY/p227/p227_191.wav|p227|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY/p247/p247_323.wav|p247|There was no hint of scandal.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_430.wav|p236|We've got a good management record.
DUMMY/p232/p232_285.wav|p232|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY/p234/p234_186.wav|p234|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
DUMMY/p243/p243_292.wav|p243|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
DUMMY/p245/p245_282.wav|p245|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY/p239/p239_120.wav|p239|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY/p236/p236_499.wav|p236|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY/p240/p240_200.wav|p240|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY/p229/p229_279.wav|p229|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY/p244/p244_039.wav|p244|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY/p232/p232_353.wav|p232|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p230/p230_132.wav|p230|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p226/p226_152.wav|p226|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p238/p238_266.wav|p238|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY/p239/p239_069.wav|p239|He will need that machine.
DUMMY/p246/p246_325.wav|p246|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
DUMMY/p247/p247_034.wav|p247|The company did not declare a dividend.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_120.wav|p227|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_068.wav|p244|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY/p240/p240_304.wav|p240|I was the sheep.
DUMMY/p248/p248_336.wav|p248|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY/p236/p236_189.wav|p236|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY/p237/p237_242.wav|p237|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
DUMMY/p243/p243_081.wav|p243|I do not attempt to answer that.
DUMMY/p231/p231_059.wav|p231|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_144.wav|p240|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY/p238/p238_256.wav|p238|This wasn't just a big crowd.
DUMMY/p248/p248_340.wav|p248|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY/p228/p228_195.wav|p228|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY/p238/p238_126.wav|p238|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_439.wav|p239|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
DUMMY/p225/p225_002.wav|p225|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p230/p230_368.wav|p230|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p244/p244_253.wav|p244|Instead, he missed the lot.
DUMMY/p228/p228_007.wav|p228|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p232/p232_134.wav|p232|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY/p238/p238_118.wav|p238|It's going to be epic.
DUMMY/p228/p228_210.wav|p228|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY/p245/p245_100.wav|p245|I was angry.
DUMMY/p230/p230_146.wav|p230|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY/p230/p230_079.wav|p230|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p237/p237_220.wav|p237|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY/p234/p234_220.wav|p234|This conference was never confirmed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_461.wav|p231|They were good years for him.
DUMMY/p238/p238_194.wav|p238|He has had success at every level.
DUMMY/p240/p240_216.wav|p240|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p248/p248_136.wav|p248|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY/p231/p231_006.wav|p231|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p240/p240_250.wav|p240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY/p244/p244_198.wav|p244|I would like to continue to develop.
DUMMY/p246/p246_103.wav|p246|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p238/p238_003.wav|p238|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p232/p232_232.wav|p232|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY/p249/p249_247.wav|p249|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_260.wav|p244|That is not the case in Europe.
DUMMY/p248/p248_048.wav|p248|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY/p243/p243_032.wav|p243|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
DUMMY/p226/p226_311.wav|p226|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY/p245/p245_116.wav|p245|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p248/p248_236.wav|p248|It's very safe.
DUMMY/p229/p229_120.wav|p229|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY/p238/p238_381.wav|p238|It was cynical and callous.
DUMMY/p249/p249_092.wav|p249|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
DUMMY/p238/p238_170.wav|p238|This is a step backwards.
DUMMY/p239/p239_041.wav|p239|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_166.wav|p226|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY/p229/p229_031.wav|p229|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY/p230/p230_396.wav|p230|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_235.wav|p247|Truth is the child of time.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_361.wav|p240|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_349.wav|p244|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p236/p236_399.wav|p236|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_083.wav|p245|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
DUMMY/p240/p240_088.wav|p240|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
DUMMY/p249/p249_298.wav|p249|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY/p230/p230_227.wav|p230|It was a day for records.
DUMMY/p232/p232_217.wav|p232|It's not ideal.
DUMMY/p226/p226_270.wav|p226|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
DUMMY/p241/p241_253.wav|p241|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY/p230/p230_169.wav|p230|On the month the weakness was across the board.
DUMMY/p228/p228_340.wav|p228|He's a genius.
DUMMY/p232/p232_236.wav|p232|We were awful.
DUMMY/p237/p237_257.wav|p237|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p234/p234_123.wav|p234|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY/p227/p227_248.wav|p227|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY/p246/p246_165.wav|p246|We should do everything at a stroke.
DUMMY/p236/p236_121.wav|p236|He is a lovely man.
DUMMY/p234/p234_318.wav|p234|The existing structure is in trouble.
DUMMY/p240/p240_093.wav|p240|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY/p246/p246_345.wav|p246|He had taken everything from me.
DUMMY/p247/p247_182.wav|p247|His team management was protective.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_116.wav|p238|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
DUMMY/p246/p246_056.wav|p246|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
DUMMY/p243/p243_187.wav|p243|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY/p236/p236_455.wav|p236|He deserved a red card.
DUMMY/p232/p232_132.wav|p232|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY/p248/p248_203.wav|p248|It's just awful.
DUMMY/p227/p227_130.wav|p227|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY/p247/p247_378.wav|p247|Yesterday was a statement of intent.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_345.wav|p237|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY/p243/p243_136.wav|p243|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
DUMMY/p238/p238_144.wav|p238|All the employees are redundant.
DUMMY/p239/p239_108.wav|p239|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY/p232/p232_025.wav|p232|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY/p225/p225_156.wav|p225|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY/p230/p230_042.wav|p230|People want to see me on the screen.
DUMMY/p245/p245_288.wav|p245|The goals will come.
DUMMY/p245/p245_229.wav|p245|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY/p225/p225_280.wav|p225|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY/p249/p249_337.wav|p249|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
DUMMY/p246/p246_358.wav|p246|Their time has gone.
DUMMY/p237/p237_275.wav|p237|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY/p246/p246_242.wav|p246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
DUMMY/p226/p226_133.wav|p226|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY/p247/p247_412.wav|p247|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY/p245/p245_124.wav|p245|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY/p247/p247_195.wav|p247|It shows the strength of the roots.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_258.wav|p248|They must play for each other.
DUMMY/p228/p228_032.wav|p228|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY/p248/p248_366.wav|p248|It is legally binding.
DUMMY/p231/p231_440.wav|p231|They said they were only young men.
DUMMY/p228/p228_013.wav|p228|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p240/p240_191.wav|p240|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY/p243/p243_379.wav|p243|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY/p230/p230_065.wav|p230|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p245/p245_350.wav|p245|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY/p228/p228_310.wav|p228|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY/p247/p247_025.wav|p247|They are very clever in their use of words.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_283.wav|p226|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY/p229/p229_303.wav|p229|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY/p246/p246_314.wav|p246|She is on a life support machine.
DUMMY/p243/p243_115.wav|p243|So what happens next ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_177.wav|p225|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY/p248/p248_318.wav|p248|I saw some good things.
DUMMY/p246/p246_014.wav|p246|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p230/p230_252.wav|p230|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
DUMMY/p248/p248_210.wav|p248|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY/p246/p246_047.wav|p246|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY/p237/p237_328.wav|p237|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p241/p241_037.wav|p241|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY/p230/p230_038.wav|p230|They said she was stable.
DUMMY/p244/p244_275.wav|p244|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY/p232/p232_088.wav|p232|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY/p244/p244_187.wav|p244|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY/p237/p237_184.wav|p237|This is a sad day.
DUMMY/p230/p230_336.wav|p230|Did it work ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_137.wav|p246|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
DUMMY/p237/p237_011.wav|p237|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p228/p228_047.wav|p228|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY/p249/p249_050.wav|p249|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p236/p236_268.wav|p236|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p245/p245_182.wav|p245|The red card was okay.
DUMMY/p227/p227_336.wav|p227|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_107.wav|p228|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY/p231/p231_035.wav|p231|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY/p248/p248_271.wav|p248|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY/p225/p225_007.wav|p225|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p244/p244_254.wav|p244|I was never in danger.
DUMMY/p228/p228_027.wav|p228|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_297.wav|p238|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY/p239/p239_368.wav|p239|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p244/p244_355.wav|p244|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY/p236/p236_333.wav|p236|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY/p241/p241_137.wav|p241|It was typical.
DUMMY/p248/p248_374.wav|p248|He's a lovely young man.
DUMMY/p228/p228_166.wav|p228|It was so new, so exciting.
DUMMY/p238/p238_255.wav|p238|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_048.wav|p232|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p240/p240_123.wav|p240|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p236/p236_205.wav|p236|It caused a lot of upset.
DUMMY/p232/p232_368.wav|p232|It was one in the afternoon.
DUMMY/p234/p234_063.wav|p234|That could be a mistake.
DUMMY/p247/p247_397.wav|p247|They have not done so this season so far.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_305.wav|p231|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY/p238/p238_122.wav|p238|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_189.wav|p248|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY/p228/p228_022.wav|p228|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p245/p245_085.wav|p245|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY/p241/p241_181.wav|p241|It is minute.
DUMMY/p229/p229_334.wav|p229|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY/p246/p246_053.wav|p246|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY/p241/p241_346.wav|p241|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_136.wav|p237|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY/p225/p225_354.wav|p225|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY/p227/p227_273.wav|p227|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY/p232/p232_153.wav|p232|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY/p239/p239_091.wav|p239|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_119.wav|p226|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY/p248/p248_330.wav|p248|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p244/p244_217.wav|p244|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY/p227/p227_020.wav|p227|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p240/p240_281.wav|p240|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY/p229/p229_149.wav|p229|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY/p227/p227_152.wav|p227|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY/p236/p236_394.wav|p236|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY/p249/p249_300.wav|p249|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p232/p232_175.wav|p232|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY/p229/p229_214.wav|p229|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY/p244/p244_320.wav|p244|Hopefully, this week will be good.
DUMMY/p231/p231_196.wav|p231|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY/p246/p246_029.wav|p246|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p227/p227_267.wav|p227|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_152.wav|p229|We just had a go.
DUMMY/p234/p234_136.wav|p234|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_351.wav|p241|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY/p248/p248_023.wav|p248|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_177.wav|p238|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY/p239/p239_137.wav|p239|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
DUMMY/p231/p231_373.wav|p231|They were to blame for the first two goals.
DUMMY/p239/p239_394.wav|p239|His leader wanted to celebrate.
DUMMY/p243/p243_353.wav|p243|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
DUMMY/p248/p248_245.wav|p248|It is hard won.
DUMMY/p231/p231_229.wav|p231|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY/p239/p239_321.wav|p239|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY/p243/p243_162.wav|p243|That will reduce my chance of selection.
DUMMY/p249/p249_166.wav|p249|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY/p230/p230_043.wav|p230|The big problem is the lack of grass.
DUMMY/p246/p246_049.wav|p246|The State would provide.
DUMMY/p245/p245_114.wav|p245|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY/p231/p231_176.wav|p231|This much I can tell you.
DUMMY/p226/p226_271.wav|p226|He was popular.
DUMMY/p230/p230_139.wav|p230|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY/p225/p225_131.wav|p225|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY/p232/p232_011.wav|p232|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p237/p237_315.wav|p237|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY/p234/p234_108.wav|p234|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY/p234/p234_054.wav|p234|We are working on it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_218.wav|p225|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY/p228/p228_087.wav|p228|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p245/p245_026.wav|p245|But it failed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_484.wav|p239|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
DUMMY/p232/p232_110.wav|p232|I don't have many friends.
DUMMY/p241/p241_034.wav|p241|And we have a singer.
DUMMY/p243/p243_130.wav|p243|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
DUMMY/p226/p226_029.wav|p226|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY/p244/p244_247.wav|p244|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_345.wav|p232|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p232/p232_155.wav|p232|This latter point is hugely important.
DUMMY/p228/p228_311.wav|p228|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY/p232/p232_095.wav|p232|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY/p228/p228_337.wav|p228|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY/p249/p249_105.wav|p249|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p241/p241_182.wav|p241|They will run a mile.
DUMMY/p229/p229_243.wav|p229|It's an idea.
DUMMY/p227/p227_361.wav|p227|A report is expected next month.
DUMMY/p238/p238_132.wav|p238|Diversions were put in place.
DUMMY/p226/p226_106.wav|p226|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY/p228/p228_071.wav|p228|The script was funny.
DUMMY/p238/p238_112.wav|p238|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY/p238/p238_351.wav|p238|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_117.wav|p232|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
DUMMY/p238/p238_307.wav|p238|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY/p232/p232_003.wav|p232|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p230/p230_170.wav|p230|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p232/p232_377.wav|p232|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY/p244/p244_375.wav|p244|It is almost certain to be the last.
DUMMY/p232/p232_279.wav|p232|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY/p234/p234_152.wav|p234|But it is different in different regions.
DUMMY/p248/p248_270.wav|p248|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY/p232/p232_293.wav|p232|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY/p225/p225_352.wav|p225|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p249/p249_256.wav|p249|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
DUMMY/p236/p236_442.wav|p236|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
DUMMY/p240/p240_319.wav|p240|They were fantastic.
DUMMY/p229/p229_028.wav|p229|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY/p249/p249_115.wav|p249|You had better believe it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_036.wav|p225|It was a close call.
DUMMY/p226/p226_127.wav|p226|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY/p234/p234_245.wav|p234|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_088.wav|p236|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_206.wav|p241|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY/p244/p244_015.wav|p244|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p249/p249_274.wav|p249|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
DUMMY/p230/p230_024.wav|p230|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p247/p247_381.wav|p247|The major championships will always have a special place.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_089.wav|p234|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_309.wav|p234|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY/p245/p245_112.wav|p245|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
DUMMY/p238/p238_332.wav|p238|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY/p230/p230_080.wav|p230|It's so hard to shift.
DUMMY/p244/p244_395.wav|p244|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY/p241/p241_235.wav|p241|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY/p231/p231_456.wav|p231|They have to be met.
DUMMY/p228/p228_305.wav|p228|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p229/p229_305.wav|p229|There is no openness.
DUMMY/p246/p246_221.wav|p246|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY/p228/p228_139.wav|p228|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
DUMMY/p240/p240_160.wav|p240|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY/p249/p249_099.wav|p249|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p246/p246_162.wav|p246|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY/p231/p231_252.wav|p231|But they were never expected to last.
DUMMY/p249/p249_260.wav|p249|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
DUMMY/p238/p238_237.wav|p238|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
DUMMY/p247/p247_016.wav|p247|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
DUMMY/p246/p246_338.wav|p246|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY/p240/p240_371.wav|p240|That would help.
DUMMY/p232/p232_028.wav|p232|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY/p236/p236_192.wav|p236|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY/p245/p245_006.wav|p245|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p230/p230_359.wav|p230|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY/p232/p232_233.wav|p232|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY/p239/p239_433.wav|p239|He was released after treatment.
DUMMY/p244/p244_329.wav|p244|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
DUMMY/p227/p227_050.wav|p227|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY/p237/p237_072.wav|p237|The end result is precisely the same.
DUMMY/p236/p236_003.wav|p236|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p225/p225_104.wav|p225|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY/p226/p226_290.wav|p226|Scotland were beaten again.
DUMMY/p245/p245_209.wav|p245|You have to do your research.
DUMMY/p243/p243_255.wav|p243|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
DUMMY/p245/p245_010.wav|p245|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_011.wav|p248|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p246/p246_120.wav|p246|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY/p234/p234_269.wav|p234|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY/p238/p238_082.wav|p238|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY/p236/p236_264.wav|p236|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY/p232/p232_408.wav|p232|Feel the air, the space.
DUMMY/p232/p232_186.wav|p232|It is the whole package.
DUMMY/p249/p249_148.wav|p249|The idea is simple.
DUMMY/p249/p249_352.wav|p249|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY/p227/p227_335.wav|p227|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_396.wav|p243|We are keen to see truth and justice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_083.wav|p228|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY/p246/p246_062.wav|p246|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY/p244/p244_296.wav|p244|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_218.wav|p245|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY/p232/p232_053.wav|p232|It's the big omission.
DUMMY/p239/p239_384.wav|p239|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
DUMMY/p227/p227_372.wav|p227|His views are hardly surprising.
DUMMY/p243/p243_390.wav|p243|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
DUMMY/p234/p234_308.wav|p234|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY/p247/p247_136.wav|p247|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_300.wav|p228|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY/p227/p227_102.wav|p227|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY/p228/p228_062.wav|p228|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY/p234/p234_282.wav|p234|My view has always been the same.
DUMMY/p237/p237_298.wav|p237|Holland won by five wickets.
DUMMY/p249/p249_080.wav|p249|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p244/p244_031.wav|p244|They were in good humour, too.
DUMMY/p231/p231_215.wav|p231|That might help a bit.
DUMMY/p227/p227_356.wav|p227|They were the acts of men.
DUMMY/p247/p247_155.wav|p247|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_293.wav|p236|Stephen will get his first cap.
DUMMY/p238/p238_384.wav|p238|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_099.wav|p229|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY/p247/p247_409.wav|p247|The idea was first mooted a year ago.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_195.wav|p237|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY/p244/p244_097.wav|p244|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p244/p244_093.wav|p244|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY/p231/p231_412.wav|p231|I will always remember the horrible images.
DUMMY/p247/p247_453.wav|p247|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_174.wav|p225|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
DUMMY/p238/p238_436.wav|p238|The only problem was, they were on himself.
DUMMY/p238/p238_321.wav|p238|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY/p231/p231_200.wav|p231|Libya is an easy target.
DUMMY/p230/p230_344.wav|p230|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY/p236/p236_104.wav|p236|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY/p244/p244_115.wav|p244|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p231/p231_445.wav|p231|It sounded like a bomb.
DUMMY/p249/p249_351.wav|p249|It was very formal.
DUMMY/p229/p229_012.wav|p229|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p237/p237_186.wav|p237|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p244/p244_404.wav|p244|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
DUMMY/p237/p237_213.wav|p237|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY/p230/p230_150.wav|p230|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
DUMMY/p230/p230_029.wav|p230|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p231/p231_258.wav|p231|It seems a shame to leave it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_413.wav|p236|He is on the wrong side.
DUMMY/p226/p226_155.wav|p226|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY/p238/p238_188.wav|p238|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
DUMMY/p241/p241_321.wav|p241|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY/p232/p232_005.wav|p232|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p244/p244_390.wav|p244|He was on a mission.
DUMMY/p248/p248_128.wav|p248|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
DUMMY/p228/p228_039.wav|p228|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY/p226/p226_194.wav|p226|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY/p244/p244_271.wav|p244|But the government has so far failed to listen.
DUMMY/p249/p249_240.wav|p249|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY/p238/p238_274.wav|p238|He is a right bastard.
DUMMY/p227/p227_292.wav|p227|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
DUMMY/p236/p236_336.wav|p236|That decision has already been made.
DUMMY/p238/p238_263.wav|p238|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY/p231/p231_442.wav|p231|The people are the hero.
DUMMY/p248/p248_089.wav|p248|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p239/p239_464.wav|p239|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
DUMMY/p229/p229_128.wav|p229|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p232/p232_017.wav|p232|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p232/p232_239.wav|p232|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY/p231/p231_141.wav|p231|I miss the freedom that I had.
DUMMY/p239/p239_392.wav|p239|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_264.wav|p232|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p230/p230_066.wav|p230|He also received a medal of honour.
DUMMY/p234/p234_119.wav|p234|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY/p228/p228_114.wav|p228|They will want to perform well.
DUMMY/p229/p229_323.wav|p229|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
DUMMY/p246/p246_188.wav|p246|It was very frightened and dirty.
DUMMY/p230/p230_191.wav|p230|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY/p246/p246_034.wav|p246|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
DUMMY/p229/p229_124.wav|p229|I joined a group.
DUMMY/p229/p229_146.wav|p229|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY/p230/p230_159.wav|p230|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_054.wav|p231|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY/p249/p249_111.wav|p249|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY/p230/p230_033.wav|p230|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY/p228/p228_117.wav|p228|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p229/p229_105.wav|p229|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY/p240/p240_239.wav|p240|It's very safe.
DUMMY/p225/p225_020.wav|p225|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_258.wav|p226|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
DUMMY/p231/p231_208.wav|p231|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY/p237/p237_033.wav|p237|This is the window.
DUMMY/p227/p227_211.wav|p227|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_045.wav|p247|Everything is possible in football.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_427.wav|p231|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY/p228/p228_246.wav|p228|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p239/p239_023.wav|p239|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p239/p239_347.wav|p239|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY/p227/p227_116.wav|p227|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY/p229/p229_147.wav|p229|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY/p240/p240_271.wav|p240|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY/p239/p239_387.wav|p239|She asked for the appointment with me.
DUMMY/p245/p245_275.wav|p245|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY/p246/p246_181.wav|p246|It's to do with context.
DUMMY/p241/p241_140.wav|p241|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY/p236/p236_110.wav|p236|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY/p228/p228_236.wav|p228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY/p248/p248_248.wav|p248|It's a record label, not a form of music.
DUMMY/p227/p227_395.wav|p227|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY/p245/p245_097.wav|p245|It was an adventure.
DUMMY/p245/p245_201.wav|p245|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p230/p230_339.wav|p230|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY/p238/p238_346.wav|p238|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p232/p232_267.wav|p232|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
DUMMY/p244/p244_405.wav|p244|It's all been about the basics of the business.
DUMMY/p246/p246_183.wav|p246|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY/p236/p236_396.wav|p236|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_263.wav|p244|The performance continues to improve.
DUMMY/p248/p248_050.wav|p248|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY/p247/p247_269.wav|p247|I didn't see the point.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_065.wav|p228|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY/p241/p241_345.wav|p241|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY/p238/p238_115.wav|p238|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
DUMMY/p234/p234_014.wav|p234|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p230/p230_379.wav|p230|We will win the argument.
DUMMY/p227/p227_098.wav|p227|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p248/p248_327.wav|p248|The train was on time.
DUMMY/p227/p227_340.wav|p227|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY/p240/p240_110.wav|p240|I came to complete.
DUMMY/p232/p232_387.wav|p232|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
DUMMY/p227/p227_319.wav|p227|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p230/p230_176.wav|p230|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY/p229/p229_007.wav|p229|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p234/p234_277.wav|p234|That would be a danger.
DUMMY/p231/p231_057.wav|p231|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p249/p249_245.wav|p249|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY/p247/p247_192.wav|p247|I will have to order its destruction.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_214.wav|p232|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_203.wav|p226|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY/p243/p243_009.wav|p243|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p248/p248_239.wav|p248|It is no surprise.
DUMMY/p245/p245_334.wav|p245|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
DUMMY/p230/p230_154.wav|p230|It has to be now.
DUMMY/p241/p241_078.wav|p241|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY/p247/p247_233.wav|p247|It will be strictly cross-country.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_039.wav|p246|Indeed, he does.
DUMMY/p226/p226_216.wav|p226|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p237/p237_334.wav|p237|I saw some good things.
DUMMY/p238/p238_453.wav|p238|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY/p237/p237_297.wav|p237|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
DUMMY/p239/p239_020.wav|p239|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p245/p245_125.wav|p245|We want to keep the pound.
DUMMY/p232/p232_097.wav|p232|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p232/p232_070.wav|p232|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p237/p237_296.wav|p237|I intended to look for another club on loan.
DUMMY/p225/p225_054.wav|p225|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p229/p229_227.wav|p229|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY/p244/p244_132.wav|p244|It is hard to believe.
DUMMY/p243/p243_183.wav|p243|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
DUMMY/p231/p231_384.wav|p231|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_033.wav|p236|This is a central issue.
DUMMY/p230/p230_367.wav|p230|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY/p225/p225_039.wav|p225|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
DUMMY/p236/p236_197.wav|p236|That is a waste of energy.
DUMMY/p243/p243_291.wav|p243|He would get into any world team.
DUMMY/p228/p228_157.wav|p228|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY/p239/p239_228.wav|p239|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p240/p240_291.wav|p240|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p230/p230_317.wav|p230|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY/p231/p231_387.wav|p231|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY/p245/p245_181.wav|p245|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY/p241/p241_254.wav|p241|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY/p243/p243_167.wav|p243|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
DUMMY/p240/p240_353.wav|p240|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
DUMMY/p243/p243_103.wav|p243|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY/p230/p230_281.wav|p230|They can leave at any time.
DUMMY/p240/p240_331.wav|p240|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY/p246/p246_194.wav|p246|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p231/p231_432.wav|p231|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY/p239/p239_100.wav|p239|Sales are falling after years of growth.
DUMMY/p229/p229_079.wav|p229|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p230/p230_415.wav|p230|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
DUMMY/p247/p247_335.wav|p247|Scotland has shown the way.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_174.wav|p241|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p243/p243_072.wav|p243|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
DUMMY/p249/p249_198.wav|p249|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY/p236/p236_439.wav|p236|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
DUMMY/p247/p247_413.wav|p247|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
DUMMY/p225/p225_241.wav|p225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY/p245/p245_205.wav|p245|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY/p241/p241_274.wav|p241|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY/p230/p230_315.wav|p230|I must do something about it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_242.wav|p240|He was good, but not that good.
DUMMY/p238/p238_362.wav|p238|It was a good workout.
DUMMY/p239/p239_481.wav|p239|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY/p239/p239_085.wav|p239|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY/p248/p248_212.wav|p248|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY/p249/p249_003.wav|p249|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p234/p234_141.wav|p234|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
DUMMY/p249/p249_317.wav|p249|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY/p238/p238_219.wav|p238|Bottling is now the core business.
DUMMY/p232/p232_146.wav|p232|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p226/p226_013.wav|p226|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p225/p225_220.wav|p225|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
DUMMY/p249/p249_043.wav|p249|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY/p245/p245_214.wav|p245|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY/p231/p231_419.wav|p231|The case will now go to appeal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_203.wav|p244|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY/p240/p240_189.wav|p240|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_126.wav|p237|I thought it was a fantastic game.
DUMMY/p230/p230_386.wav|p230|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY/p247/p247_350.wav|p247|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY/p236/p236_117.wav|p236|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_019.wav|p229|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p237/p237_066.wav|p237|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
DUMMY/p234/p234_065.wav|p234|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY/p239/p239_055.wav|p239|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p244/p244_409.wav|p244|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY/p230/p230_161.wav|p230|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_168.wav|p247|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_209.wav|p234|I will be in Scotland.
DUMMY/p246/p246_176.wav|p246|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p237/p237_241.wav|p237|They tried to give her advice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_165.wav|p228|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY/p238/p238_173.wav|p238|The festivals will be about having fun.
DUMMY/p240/p240_179.wav|p240|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY/p236/p236_158.wav|p236|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY/p248/p248_320.wav|p248|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY/p240/p240_135.wav|p240|Government will intervene.
DUMMY/p239/p239_438.wav|p239|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
DUMMY/p238/p238_444.wav|p238|I believe we can handle this okay.
DUMMY/p241/p241_306.wav|p241|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
DUMMY/p229/p229_354.wav|p229|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p229/p229_196.wav|p229|Four policemen were wounded.
DUMMY/p229/p229_186.wav|p229|Is Saddam a threat ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_470.wav|p239|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY/p248/p248_127.wav|p248|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY/p229/p229_332.wav|p229|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY/p236/p236_072.wav|p236|These people are not big names.
DUMMY/p247/p247_204.wav|p247|They have the cash and the fire power.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_096.wav|p241|The peace process will be buried!
DUMMY/p227/p227_394.wav|p227|I wanted to go out on a high.
DUMMY/p231/p231_222.wav|p231|That you can do it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_174.wav|p246|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY/p228/p228_118.wav|p228|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY/p231/p231_170.wav|p231|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY/p238/p238_287.wav|p238|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY/p248/p248_155.wav|p248|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY/p229/p229_071.wav|p229|Neither it is.
DUMMY/p245/p245_048.wav|p245|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p227/p227_216.wav|p227|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY/p231/p231_202.wav|p231|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_167.wav|p236|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
DUMMY/p232/p232_096.wav|p232|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY/p247/p247_446.wav|p247|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_302.wav|p231|It could well be military.
DUMMY/p244/p244_130.wav|p244|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY/p241/p241_349.wav|p241|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY/p239/p239_313.wav|p239|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_072.wav|p232|That was the easy election.
DUMMY/p245/p245_278.wav|p245|Yet, it worked.
DUMMY/p225/p225_017.wav|p225|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p238/p238_131.wav|p238|This is a sizeable part of our business.
DUMMY/p247/p247_056.wav|p247|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_288.wav|p246|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY/p232/p232_298.wav|p232|He should have won.
DUMMY/p249/p249_193.wav|p249|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_079.wav|p237|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY/p230/p230_178.wav|p230|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY/p230/p230_122.wav|p230|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
DUMMY/p229/p229_197.wav|p229|What has caused the demise of singing ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_011.wav|p239|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p226/p226_343.wav|p226|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY/p226/p226_305.wav|p226|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p231/p231_138.wav|p231|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY/p243/p243_010.wav|p243|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_021.wav|p227|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p228/p228_356.wav|p228|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY/p236/p236_126.wav|p236|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY/p228/p228_217.wav|p228|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
DUMMY/p247/p247_156.wav|p247|Before it was an ordeal.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_314.wav|p243|He felt too close to head office.
DUMMY/p231/p231_136.wav|p231|He is a great addition to our team.
DUMMY/p229/p229_232.wav|p229|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY/p243/p243_127.wav|p243|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
DUMMY/p226/p226_068.wav|p226|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p236/p236_209.wav|p236|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p228/p228_208.wav|p228|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p239/p239_278.wav|p239|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY/p240/p240_089.wav|p240|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p225/p225_063.wav|p225|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p232/p232_212.wav|p232|He knows a lot.
DUMMY/p232/p232_390.wav|p232|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY/p246/p246_017.wav|p246|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p226/p226_005.wav|p226|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p226/p226_128.wav|p226|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY/p243/p243_119.wav|p243|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
DUMMY/p225/p225_336.wav|p225|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p225/p225_197.wav|p225|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_256.wav|p226|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p231/p231_330.wav|p231|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
DUMMY/p234/p234_050.wav|p234|The strategy is not without risk.
DUMMY/p234/p234_191.wav|p234|It is not in the public interest.
DUMMY/p236/p236_075.wav|p236|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY/p243/p243_208.wav|p243|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
DUMMY/p231/p231_048.wav|p231|There was no safety net.
DUMMY/p243/p243_156.wav|p243|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
DUMMY/p229/p229_368.wav|p229|I am a star.
DUMMY/p239/p239_039.wav|p239|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_436.wav|p231|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
DUMMY/p243/p243_132.wav|p243|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
DUMMY/p238/p238_077.wav|p238|I have made that offer.
DUMMY/p248/p248_372.wav|p248|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY/p237/p237_330.wav|p237|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p228/p228_346.wav|p228|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY/p236/p236_367.wav|p236|The work with Alison was a great experience.
DUMMY/p229/p229_108.wav|p229|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY/p248/p248_132.wav|p248|It's the big omission.
DUMMY/p231/p231_105.wav|p231|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_300.wav|p234|And it was this one.
DUMMY/p229/p229_233.wav|p229|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p236/p236_474.wav|p236|He was a shooting star.
DUMMY/p243/p243_234.wav|p243|The labour side has developed in the North area.
DUMMY/p246/p246_071.wav|p246|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY/p244/p244_080.wav|p244|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_418.wav|p247|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_015.wav|p240|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_237.wav|p241|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
DUMMY/p245/p245_194.wav|p245|He knows a lot.
DUMMY/p239/p239_176.wav|p239|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY/p238/p238_211.wav|p238|But experts have disputed that statistic.
DUMMY/p249/p249_234.wav|p249|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p232/p232_311.wav|p232|Special measures were needed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_343.wav|p241|Tiger is the exception.
DUMMY/p231/p231_177.wav|p231|The Hibs manager is no fool.
DUMMY/p243/p243_021.wav|p243|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p241/p241_205.wav|p241|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p229/p229_094.wav|p229|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY/p227/p227_075.wav|p227|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY/p231/p231_475.wav|p231|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY/p231/p231_213.wav|p231|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p236/p236_362.wav|p236|It's only a matter of scale.
DUMMY/p232/p232_295.wav|p232|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY/p225/p225_115.wav|p225|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
DUMMY/p236/p236_203.wav|p236|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY/p241/p241_281.wav|p241|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
DUMMY/p244/p244_277.wav|p244|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
DUMMY/p231/p231_080.wav|p231|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY/p239/p239_098.wav|p239|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY/p231/p231_272.wav|p231|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
DUMMY/p228/p228_103.wav|p228|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY/p240/p240_292.wav|p240|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p237/p237_138.wav|p237|They took a risk.
DUMMY/p236/p236_433.wav|p236|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
DUMMY/p227/p227_138.wav|p227|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p238/p238_236.wav|p238|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
DUMMY/p234/p234_079.wav|p234|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
DUMMY/p237/p237_102.wav|p237|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY/p239/p239_054.wav|p239|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY/p225/p225_322.wav|p225|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY/p248/p248_107.wav|p248|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY/p234/p234_122.wav|p234|That admission is not surprising.
DUMMY/p247/p247_309.wav|p247|The rescue package is public money.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_375.wav|p248|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY/p232/p232_218.wav|p232|He seemed to lose his focus.
DUMMY/p246/p246_302.wav|p246|She is really magic.
DUMMY/p239/p239_247.wav|p239|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY/p230/p230_062.wav|p230|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY/p243/p243_068.wav|p243|But it was not all bad news.
DUMMY/p231/p231_220.wav|p231|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY/p228/p228_060.wav|p228|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY/p228/p228_290.wav|p228|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY/p226/p226_368.wav|p226|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY/p244/p244_102.wav|p244|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY/p228/p228_258.wav|p228|They are real.
DUMMY/p244/p244_157.wav|p244|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY/p228/p228_055.wav|p228|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY/p239/p239_222.wav|p239|There's always the next century.
DUMMY/p227/p227_004.wav|p227|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p247/p247_226.wav|p247|The process will start tomorrow.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_374.wav|p232|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY/p239/p239_457.wav|p239|It was never a free kick.
DUMMY/p229/p229_392.wav|p229|Yet the data is compelling.
DUMMY/p236/p236_020.wav|p236|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p247/p247_266.wav|p247|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_324.wav|p229|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY/p226/p226_253.wav|p226|I was never going to play against Scotland.
DUMMY/p243/p243_145.wav|p243|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY/p234/p234_100.wav|p234|It should be a condition of employment.
DUMMY/p226/p226_067.wav|p226|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p244/p244_363.wav|p244|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY/p232/p232_275.wav|p232|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY/p246/p246_122.wav|p246|It is not a U-turn.
DUMMY/p246/p246_337.wav|p246|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY/p229/p229_256.wav|p229|This year I understood.
DUMMY/p248/p248_131.wav|p248|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY/p246/p246_054.wav|p246|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p232/p232_201.wav|p232|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY/p241/p241_109.wav|p241|You had better believe it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_219.wav|p228|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p225/p225_021.wav|p225|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p228/p228_274.wav|p228|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY/p231/p231_030.wav|p231|That deal is a joke.
DUMMY/p232/p232_078.wav|p232|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p229/p229_119.wav|p229|It's not fair.
DUMMY/p237/p237_240.wav|p237|You take a risk.
DUMMY/p230/p230_124.wav|p230|She was also very brave.
DUMMY/p244/p244_010.wav|p244|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_040.wav|p239|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_138.wav|p238|Monty is great in his own backyard.
DUMMY/p238/p238_233.wav|p238|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
DUMMY/p231/p231_019.wav|p231|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p248/p248_173.wav|p248|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY/p244/p244_274.wav|p244|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY/p227/p227_030.wav|p227|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p237/p237_340.wav|p237|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY/p227/p227_322.wav|p227|The judge was really nice.
DUMMY/p238/p238_186.wav|p238|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
DUMMY/p232/p232_020.wav|p232|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_386.wav|p227|I do not like to lose.
DUMMY/p241/p241_197.wav|p241|Is that success?
DUMMY/p245/p245_193.wav|p245|Feel the heat?
DUMMY/p244/p244_424.wav|p244|But it was a struggle.
DUMMY/p232/p232_176.wav|p232|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p238/p238_101.wav|p238|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
DUMMY/p231/p231_275.wav|p231|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
DUMMY/p248/p248_193.wav|p248|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_169.wav|p241|It is too much for me.
DUMMY/p236/p236_302.wav|p236|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY/p241/p241_009.wav|p241|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p241/p241_279.wav|p241|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY/p231/p231_231.wav|p231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY/p234/p234_228.wav|p234|Mr Blair was ready for him.
DUMMY/p234/p234_353.wav|p234|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY/p247/p247_183.wav|p247|One season, they might do well.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_022.wav|p245|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p249/p249_219.wav|p249|There was an e-mail.
DUMMY/p237/p237_105.wav|p237|I didn't play well last year.
DUMMY/p227/p227_344.wav|p227|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY/p231/p231_313.wav|p231|I thought he did very well.
DUMMY/p225/p225_004.wav|p225|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p249/p249_213.wav|p249|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY/p232/p232_357.wav|p232|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY/p225/p225_159.wav|p225|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY/p241/p241_243.wav|p241|The scene is about this?
DUMMY/p249/p249_263.wav|p249|They are never here.
DUMMY/p238/p238_360.wav|p238|I saw them last week.
DUMMY/p227/p227_141.wav|p227|He's not a Celtic man.
DUMMY/p237/p237_080.wav|p237|It may well have been.
DUMMY/p245/p245_137.wav|p245|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY/p247/p247_470.wav|p247|They were good years for him.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_010.wav|p228|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_307.wav|p236|The rescue package is public money.
DUMMY/p232/p232_034.wav|p232|It is marvellous.
DUMMY/p238/p238_141.wav|p238|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
DUMMY/p234/p234_120.wav|p234|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY/p226/p226_251.wav|p226|There's the mix.
DUMMY/p228/p228_212.wav|p228|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY/p248/p248_282.wav|p248|It was a virus.
DUMMY/p249/p249_258.wav|p249|They must play for each other.
DUMMY/p241/p241_059.wav|p241|There was a battle there.
DUMMY/p240/p240_146.wav|p240|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p239/p239_268.wav|p239|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY/p248/p248_037.wav|p248|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
DUMMY/p245/p245_154.wav|p245|We wanted it left for a wee while.
DUMMY/p228/p228_224.wav|p228|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p239/p239_250.wav|p239|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY/p246/p246_190.wav|p246|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY/p245/p245_101.wav|p245|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY/p248/p248_276.wav|p248|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY/p231/p231_216.wav|p231|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY/p227/p227_018.wav|p227|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p239/p239_261.wav|p239|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
DUMMY/p248/p248_045.wav|p248|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p236/p236_276.wav|p236|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY/p246/p246_163.wav|p246|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p230/p230_223.wav|p230|How do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_266.wav|p243|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY/p239/p239_319.wav|p239|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY/p226/p226_324.wav|p226|We are in the end game.
DUMMY/p245/p245_212.wav|p245|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY/p226/p226_108.wav|p226|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY/p248/p248_170.wav|p248|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
DUMMY/p241/p241_340.wav|p241|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY/p231/p231_050.wav|p231|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY/p227/p227_397.wav|p227|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY/p245/p245_103.wav|p245|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY/p236/p236_445.wav|p236|Taxes may need to rise.
DUMMY/p225/p225_149.wav|p225|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
DUMMY/p232/p232_075.wav|p232|The price cuts are really exciting.
DUMMY/p239/p239_360.wav|p239|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY/p239/p239_161.wav|p239|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
DUMMY/p247/p247_008.wav|p247|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
DUMMY/p230/p230_322.wav|p230|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY/p231/p231_431.wav|p231|I was in jail for five years.
DUMMY/p237/p237_292.wav|p237|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY/p234/p234_210.wav|p234|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY/p247/p247_142.wav|p247|I learned that only yesterday.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_348.wav|p234|The answer was in space.
DUMMY/p244/p244_250.wav|p244|Sadly, it could not be done.
DUMMY/p246/p246_254.wav|p246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY/p231/p231_058.wav|p231|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY/p245/p245_107.wav|p245|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY/p231/p231_357.wav|p231|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY/p230/p230_071.wav|p230|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_098.wav|p238|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY/p237/p237_124.wav|p237|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_221.wav|p247|We used to live with dignity in our country.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_394.wav|p247|Theatre is not a museum.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_168.wav|p228|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY/p238/p238_130.wav|p238|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY/p230/p230_271.wav|p230|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY/p231/p231_241.wav|p231|The parties have no contact.
DUMMY/p238/p238_195.wav|p238|This Patton will also return.
DUMMY/p232/p232_061.wav|p232|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY/p237/p237_329.wav|p237|I am so upset.
DUMMY/p230/p230_045.wav|p230|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY/p243/p243_216.wav|p243|I am not going to judge them.
DUMMY/p227/p227_250.wav|p227|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY/p228/p228_044.wav|p228|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY/p236/p236_105.wav|p236|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
DUMMY/p230/p230_179.wav|p230|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY/p232/p232_323.wav|p232|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p229/p229_247.wav|p229|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
DUMMY/p238/p238_277.wav|p238|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY/p236/p236_403.wav|p236|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
DUMMY/p246/p246_339.wav|p246|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
DUMMY/p231/p231_453.wav|p231|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY/p245/p245_259.wav|p245|I HAVE a dream.
DUMMY/p227/p227_307.wav|p227|Size is not the issue.
DUMMY/p230/p230_183.wav|p230|They will run a mile.
DUMMY/p240/p240_288.wav|p240|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
DUMMY/p229/p229_133.wav|p229|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY/p228/p228_034.wav|p228|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY/p238/p238_028.wav|p238|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY/p247/p247_428.wav|p247|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_147.wav|p228|Who would be right ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_156.wav|p246|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
DUMMY/p230/p230_078.wav|p230|This is a true story.
DUMMY/p240/p240_071.wav|p240|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
DUMMY/p226/p226_353.wav|p226|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
DUMMY/p226/p226_092.wav|p226|It's just awful.
DUMMY/p244/p244_229.wav|p244|It still has an effect.
DUMMY/p225/p225_011.wav|p225|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p231/p231_312.wav|p231|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p230/p230_309.wav|p230|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p225/p225_331.wav|p225|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
DUMMY/p246/p246_117.wav|p246|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY/p227/p227_045.wav|p227|He was a home referee.
DUMMY/p246/p246_124.wav|p246|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY/p227/p227_332.wav|p227|I would do away with the dress code.
DUMMY/p227/p227_119.wav|p227|We did what we had to do.
DUMMY/p231/p231_248.wav|p231|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY/p244/p244_064.wav|p244|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY/p249/p249_136.wav|p249|What will happen then?
DUMMY/p226/p226_247.wav|p226|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY/p248/p248_356.wav|p248|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY/p238/p238_024.wav|p238|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p240/p240_065.wav|p240|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p229/p229_116.wav|p229|I was angry.
DUMMY/p244/p244_050.wav|p244|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY/p230/p230_245.wav|p230|I was just a kid.
DUMMY/p236/p236_409.wav|p236|I would love to think that she could win.
DUMMY/p227/p227_304.wav|p227|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p234/p234_240.wav|p234|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY/p230/p230_012.wav|p230|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p244/p244_144.wav|p244|I have been in contact with him.
DUMMY/p245/p245_281.wav|p245|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY/p240/p240_048.wav|p240|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY/p229/p229_015.wav|p229|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_161.wav|p241|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY/p244/p244_291.wav|p244|None of the agencies was able to help.
DUMMY/p236/p236_164.wav|p236|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
DUMMY/p248/p248_094.wav|p248|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY/p238/p238_145.wav|p238|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
DUMMY/p248/p248_124.wav|p248|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY/p239/p239_016.wav|p239|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p246/p246_098.wav|p246|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY/p236/p236_181.wav|p236|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_202.wav|p241|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p236/p236_405.wav|p236|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY/p227/p227_246.wav|p227|She died in middle age.
DUMMY/p241/p241_091.wav|p241|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY/p225/p225_334.wav|p225|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
DUMMY/p236/p236_026.wav|p236|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
DUMMY/p236/p236_476.wav|p236|I am a committed European.
DUMMY/p230/p230_095.wav|p230|We intend to change the model.
DUMMY/p232/p232_151.wav|p232|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY/p244/p244_384.wav|p244|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
DUMMY/p240/p240_171.wav|p240|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY/p249/p249_107.wav|p249|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY/p239/p239_306.wav|p239|This will be our new beginning.
DUMMY/p239/p239_303.wav|p239|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY/p234/p234_111.wav|p234|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
DUMMY/p239/p239_123.wav|p239|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_359.wav|p243|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
DUMMY/p236/p236_451.wav|p236|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
DUMMY/p226/p226_370.wav|p226|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY/p239/p239_183.wav|p239|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY/p229/p229_165.wav|p229|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
DUMMY/p227/p227_268.wav|p227|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_285.wav|p228|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY/p238/p238_203.wav|p238|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_228.wav|p230|He remains a main board director of Royal.
DUMMY/p225/p225_265.wav|p225|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
DUMMY/p228/p228_024.wav|p228|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_177.wav|p237|The release attracted little attention.
DUMMY/p230/p230_324.wav|p230|We were on our way.
DUMMY/p244/p244_184.wav|p244|It should never have happened.
DUMMY/p247/p247_105.wav|p247|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_017.wav|p231|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p238/p238_246.wav|p238|Then we will face the Danish champions.
DUMMY/p239/p239_032.wav|p239|That's all I was trying to do today.
DUMMY/p240/p240_150.wav|p240|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
DUMMY/p226/p226_030.wav|p226|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_190.wav|p228|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p245/p245_243.wav|p245|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY/p232/p232_412.wav|p232|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
DUMMY/p244/p244_223.wav|p244|Because he was born in England.
DUMMY/p243/p243_171.wav|p243|You need a long-term strategy in football.
DUMMY/p246/p246_215.wav|p246|The report is due out next month.
DUMMY/p228/p228_119.wav|p228|It's in his blood.
DUMMY/p234/p234_306.wav|p234|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY/p246/p246_259.wav|p246|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
DUMMY/p246/p246_139.wav|p246|She died at her home.
DUMMY/p247/p247_112.wav|p247|Athletics is on a roll in the country.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_217.wav|p247|What was the matter for concern ?)
DUMMY/p225/p225_281.wav|p225|They were not at the property yesterday.
DUMMY/p234/p234_236.wav|p234|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY/p245/p245_321.wav|p245|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY/p239/p239_310.wav|p239|Racism has no place in any sport.
DUMMY/p236/p236_397.wav|p236|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_065.wav|p249|You did not change overnight.
DUMMY/p234/p234_257.wav|p234|The matter is under appeal.
DUMMY/p228/p228_283.wav|p228|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p228/p228_249.wav|p228|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY/p247/p247_101.wav|p247|It was clear on Thursday.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_312.wav|p244|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY/p241/p241_288.wav|p241|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY/p226/p226_237.wav|p226|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY/p248/p248_298.wav|p248|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY/p236/p236_415.wav|p236|I've got my own ideas.
DUMMY/p239/p239_042.wav|p239|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_057.wav|p245|None has ever been found.
DUMMY/p246/p246_273.wav|p246|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p239/p239_287.wav|p239|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY/p243/p243_336.wav|p243|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
DUMMY/p228/p228_343.wav|p228|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY/p236/p236_044.wav|p236|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY/p228/p228_002.wav|p228|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p230/p230_377.wav|p230|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
DUMMY/p239/p239_315.wav|p239|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_061.wav|p240|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY/p237/p237_004.wav|p237|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p239/p239_357.wav|p239|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_361.wav|p238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p226/p226_310.wav|p226|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY/p227/p227_337.wav|p227|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_277.wav|p236|We run within the law.
DUMMY/p228/p228_141.wav|p228|I was the last man to touch the ball.
DUMMY/p248/p248_283.wav|p248|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY/p230/p230_356.wav|p230|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p231/p231_115.wav|p231|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY/p229/p229_365.wav|p229|We are looking for perfection.
DUMMY/p245/p245_121.wav|p245|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
DUMMY/p229/p229_132.wav|p229|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p227/p227_349.wav|p227|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p245/p245_244.wav|p245|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY/p232/p232_375.wav|p232|It was a double tragedy for the family.
DUMMY/p231/p231_163.wav|p231|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_026.wav|p232|But it failed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_169.wav|p237|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY/p230/p230_404.wav|p230|It does not even have a staff shortage.
DUMMY/p228/p228_124.wav|p228|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
DUMMY/p238/p238_323.wav|p238|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY/p243/p243_193.wav|p243|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
DUMMY/p245/p245_277.wav|p245|It was a virus.
DUMMY/p239/p239_413.wav|p239|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY/p237/p237_114.wav|p237|I came to complete.
DUMMY/p245/p245_260.wav|p245|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY/p234/p234_287.wav|p234|How independent is that ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_026.wav|p227|Movement has to take place.
DUMMY/p238/p238_007.wav|p238|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p244/p244_048.wav|p244|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY/p249/p249_121.wav|p249|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY/p243/p243_149.wav|p243|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_135.wav|p234|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_181.wav|p229|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_325.wav|p237|We are very strongly behind the bid.
DUMMY/p227/p227_269.wav|p227|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_386.wav|p238|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_134.wav|p245|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY/p247/p247_256.wav|p247|It might be sad, but it's a fact.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_460.wav|p231|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
DUMMY/p245/p245_177.wav|p245|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY/p227/p227_188.wav|p227|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_073.wav|p226|The script was funny.
DUMMY/p234/p234_188.wav|p234|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p248/p248_148.wav|p248|It is like a football team.
DUMMY/p246/p246_223.wav|p246|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
DUMMY/p231/p231_072.wav|p231|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p232/p232_197.wav|p232|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY/p249/p249_342.wav|p249|He's a genius.
DUMMY/p236/p236_303.wav|p236|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p243/p243_354.wav|p243|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY/p234/p234_293.wav|p234|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY/p232/p232_220.wav|p232|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p227/p227_262.wav|p227|Our decision making was poor.
DUMMY/p244/p244_035.wav|p244|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p231/p231_031.wav|p231|The Premier League has been a huge success.
DUMMY/p247/p247_145.wav|p247|You are a gambling man.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_028.wav|p231|There was a rush of water.
DUMMY/p232/p232_333.wav|p232|I'd like to take the plunge.
DUMMY/p228/p228_106.wav|p228|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY/p249/p249_072.wav|p249|Try to save us.
DUMMY/p236/p236_024.wav|p236|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p240/p240_182.wav|p240|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY/p225/p225_027.wav|p225|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_333.wav|p227|It is so easy to be negative.
DUMMY/p230/p230_096.wav|p230|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
DUMMY/p234/p234_358.wav|p234|Something is going to have to give.
DUMMY/p241/p241_160.wav|p241|We do not get that impression now.
DUMMY/p228/p228_239.wav|p228|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
DUMMY/p240/p240_225.wav|p240|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY/p237/p237_318.wav|p237|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY/p247/p247_078.wav|p247|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_232.wav|p243|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
DUMMY/p227/p227_140.wav|p227|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_301.wav|p227|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_076.wav|p241|He is now resident in England.
DUMMY/p241/p241_048.wav|p241|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p225/p225_037.wav|p225|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY/p226/p226_340.wav|p226|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY/p234/p234_327.wav|p234|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY/p243/p243_191.wav|p243|You are not long home from work.
DUMMY/p231/p231_250.wav|p231|The baby deserves the credit.
DUMMY/p238/p238_247.wav|p238|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY/p247/p247_360.wav|p247|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_045.wav|p244|They are going after them.
DUMMY/p244/p244_006.wav|p244|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p234/p234_168.wav|p234|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
DUMMY/p228/p228_109.wav|p228|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY/p230/p230_184.wav|p230|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY/p225/p225_176.wav|p225|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY/p244/p244_367.wav|p244|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
DUMMY/p234/p234_214.wav|p234|This is an interesting link.
DUMMY/p249/p249_191.wav|p249|It is not fair.
DUMMY/p228/p228_282.wav|p228|He was obviously very genuine.
DUMMY/p232/p232_106.wav|p232|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY/p246/p246_106.wav|p246|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
DUMMY/p231/p231_181.wav|p231|I am not ready to walk away.
DUMMY/p247/p247_315.wav|p247|His job was not advertised.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_229.wav|p229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p232/p232_317.wav|p232|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_264.wav|p247|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_374.wav|p244|However, it does not seem to be the case.
DUMMY/p229/p229_136.wav|p229|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY/p231/p231_212.wav|p231|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY/p236/p236_237.wav|p236|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p234/p234_326.wav|p234|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_180.wav|p241|They know no other way.
DUMMY/p238/p238_421.wav|p238|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p243/p243_165.wav|p243|But the game is still wide open.
DUMMY/p228/p228_001.wav|p228|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p239/p239_185.wav|p239|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY/p237/p237_174.wav|p237|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY/p246/p246_291.wav|p246|It was a virus.
DUMMY/p228/p228_276.wav|p228|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p232/p232_007.wav|p232|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p227/p227_175.wav|p227|The jury is still out.
DUMMY/p243/p243_258.wav|p243|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
DUMMY/p237/p237_041.wav|p237|He did not know his daughter.
DUMMY/p231/p231_133.wav|p231|It is a common problem.
DUMMY/p230/p230_182.wav|p230|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY/p241/p241_203.wav|p241|He's not perfect.
DUMMY/p246/p246_264.wav|p246|It will be done in stages.
DUMMY/p241/p241_238.wav|p241|It is hard won.
DUMMY/p230/p230_035.wav|p230|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY/p227/p227_299.wav|p227|She failed in her action.
DUMMY/p230/p230_285.wav|p230|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_198.wav|p248|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY/p245/p245_164.wav|p245|It is not fair.
DUMMY/p234/p234_038.wav|p234|Victory was never in doubt.
DUMMY/p240/p240_095.wav|p240|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY/p228/p228_256.wav|p228|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY/p241/p241_007.wav|p241|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p228/p228_092.wav|p228|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_238.wav|p227|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY/p241/p241_209.wav|p241|But I am a worried man.
DUMMY/p234/p234_024.wav|p234|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p226/p226_293.wav|p226|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
DUMMY/p232/p232_022.wav|p232|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p231/p231_331.wav|p231|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
DUMMY/p227/p227_016.wav|p227|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p232/p232_362.wav|p232|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p239/p239_076.wav|p239|The Government does not go far enough.
DUMMY/p248/p248_084.wav|p248|We have other options.
DUMMY/p226/p226_069.wav|p226|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
DUMMY/p238/p238_070.wav|p238|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY/p232/p232_049.wav|p232|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
DUMMY/p231/p231_205.wav|p231|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_121.wav|p246|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY/p247/p247_178.wav|p247|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_130.wav|p248|I had relied on him.
DUMMY/p234/p234_085.wav|p234|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_109.wav|p230|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY/p230/p230_061.wav|p230|But the challenge is in the US.
DUMMY/p226/p226_238.wav|p226|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY/p246/p246_026.wav|p246|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
DUMMY/p243/p243_067.wav|p243|He was failed by his health authority.
DUMMY/p244/p244_069.wav|p244|It was an outstanding performance.
DUMMY/p236/p236_099.wav|p236|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p228/p228_096.wav|p228|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY/p240/p240_131.wav|p240|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY/p227/p227_251.wav|p227|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_334.wav|p243|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
DUMMY/p249/p249_022.wav|p249|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p229/p229_231.wav|p229|We've got the bronze.
DUMMY/p232/p232_321.wav|p232|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY/p229/p229_290.wav|p229|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY/p230/p230_050.wav|p230|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY/p227/p227_011.wav|p227|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_127.wav|p244|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY/p243/p243_102.wav|p243|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY/p226/p226_298.wav|p226|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p243/p243_393.wav|p243|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
DUMMY/p240/p240_222.wav|p240|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p226/p226_158.wav|p226|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY/p240/p240_256.wav|p240|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY/p247/p247_224.wav|p247|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_269.wav|p239|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
DUMMY/p239/p239_224.wav|p239|But it's an enjoyable job.
DUMMY/p228/p228_332.wav|p228|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY/p245/p245_024.wav|p245|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_229.wav|p237|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
DUMMY/p243/p243_244.wav|p243|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_118.wav|p245|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY/p243/p243_229.wav|p243|I want to see as much progress as possible.
DUMMY/p245/p245_021.wav|p245|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p231/p231_143.wav|p231|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY/p226/p226_099.wav|p226|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY/p247/p247_068.wav|p247|The Farmer wants a new campaign.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_072.wav|p228|Try to save us.
DUMMY/p249/p249_018.wav|p249|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_240.wav|p241|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p228/p228_194.wav|p228|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY/p234/p234_285.wav|p234|Do you think we're a top nation ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_490.wav|p236|I had it before the final.
DUMMY/p237/p237_139.wav|p237|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
DUMMY/p236/p236_281.wav|p236|They must play for each other.
DUMMY/p225/p225_142.wav|p225|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY/p225/p225_323.wav|p225|It is a court case.
DUMMY/p248/p248_289.wav|p248|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p236/p236_492.wav|p236|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p227/p227_321.wav|p227|I have got a victim.
DUMMY/p231/p231_353.wav|p231|The units will not be replaced.
DUMMY/p247/p247_383.wav|p247|It's as wide as a church in here.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_490.wav|p239|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
DUMMY/p245/p245_142.wav|p245|Was this element always there?
DUMMY/p227/p227_196.wav|p227|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
DUMMY/p228/p228_084.wav|p228|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
DUMMY/p243/p243_061.wav|p243|Talks have continued at many different levels.
DUMMY/p238/p238_412.wav|p238|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
DUMMY/p241/p241_309.wav|p241|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY/p232/p232_067.wav|p232|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
DUMMY/p232/p232_016.wav|p232|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p239/p239_399.wav|p239|Both sides have to step back.
DUMMY/p228/p228_324.wav|p228|There was no option.
DUMMY/p227/p227_076.wav|p227|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_018.wav|p240|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p241/p241_103.wav|p241|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY/p239/p239_203.wav|p239|It is all to do with the coaching.
DUMMY/p247/p247_100.wav|p247|And they had a case.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_329.wav|p240|We do the same.
DUMMY/p237/p237_155.wav|p237|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
DUMMY/p232/p232_306.wav|p232|It is a road of death.
DUMMY/p241/p241_220.wav|p241|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p246/p246_004.wav|p246|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p225/p225_016.wav|p225|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p239/p239_246.wav|p239|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY/p228/p228_081.wav|p228|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY/p226/p226_364.wav|p226|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY/p239/p239_333.wav|p239|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
DUMMY/p226/p226_206.wav|p226|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
DUMMY/p230/p230_113.wav|p230|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_213.wav|p244|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
DUMMY/p244/p244_325.wav|p244|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
DUMMY/p229/p229_169.wav|p229|Was this element always there ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_115.wav|p228|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
DUMMY/p239/p239_500.wav|p239|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
DUMMY/p234/p234_233.wav|p234|But it may not be all bad news.
DUMMY/p238/p238_087.wav|p238|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p240/p240_268.wav|p240|There is no link.
DUMMY/p248/p248_126.wav|p248|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
DUMMY/p230/p230_327.wav|p230|We have a good healthy debate.
DUMMY/p243/p243_391.wav|p243|My tax affairs have been totally open.
DUMMY/p241/p241_043.wav|p241|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY/p236/p236_374.wav|p236|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY/p229/p229_003.wav|p229|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p231/p231_385.wav|p231|You have to rely on each other.
DUMMY/p239/p239_398.wav|p239|We were beaten by the better team.
DUMMY/p237/p237_267.wav|p237|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY/p228/p228_009.wav|p228|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p237/p237_081.wav|p237|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY/p243/p243_387.wav|p243|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
DUMMY/p249/p249_292.wav|p249|He should have won.
DUMMY/p244/p244_286.wav|p244|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
DUMMY/p229/p229_166.wav|p229|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY/p231/p231_391.wav|p231|The response from them was good.
DUMMY/p240/p240_322.wav|p240|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY/p247/p247_468.wav|p247|That should get their attention.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_089.wav|p237|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY/p248/p248_222.wav|p248|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p240/p240_284.wav|p240|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY/p225/p225_286.wav|p225|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY/p240/p240_247.wav|p240|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY/p231/p231_219.wav|p231|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY/p247/p247_120.wav|p247|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_160.wav|p239|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY/p225/p225_086.wav|p225|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
DUMMY/p236/p236_229.wav|p236|Death is outside the language.
DUMMY/p241/p241_293.wav|p241|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
DUMMY/p232/p232_341.wav|p232|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
DUMMY/p231/p231_365.wav|p231|Neither woman has been named.
DUMMY/p229/p229_218.wav|p229|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY/p249/p249_103.wav|p249|Until you hit the big games.
DUMMY/p225/p225_238.wav|p225|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY/p247/p247_314.wav|p247|Britain is going to celebrate in style.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_329.wav|p225|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p229/p229_115.wav|p229|I came to complete.
DUMMY/p226/p226_254.wav|p226|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY/p247/p247_239.wav|p247|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_165.wav|p232|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY/p227/p227_338.wav|p227|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_350.wav|p246|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY/p231/p231_243.wav|p231|Nato was not a love affair.
DUMMY/p237/p237_304.wav|p237|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p228/p228_156.wav|p228|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p234/p234_017.wav|p234|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p246/p246_245.wav|p246|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p239/p239_239.wav|p239|This is absolutely not true.
DUMMY/p248/p248_055.wav|p248|Here's a clue.
DUMMY/p236/p236_061.wav|p236|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY/p239/p239_296.wav|p239|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY/p247/p247_451.wav|p247|But you can go beyond that condition.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_034.wav|p234|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
DUMMY/p248/p248_264.wav|p248|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY/p238/p238_339.wav|p238|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY/p240/p240_006.wav|p240|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_283.wav|p243|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY/p246/p246_222.wav|p246|It's not before time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_075.wav|p243|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
DUMMY/p234/p234_026.wav|p234|But we will have to wait.
DUMMY/p229/p229_135.wav|p229|It's an amazing landscape !
DUMMY/p246/p246_191.wav|p246|Is that success?
DUMMY/p238/p238_029.wav|p238|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY/p249/p249_312.wav|p249|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
DUMMY/p227/p227_002.wav|p227|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p237/p237_309.wav|p237|It is a road of death.
DUMMY/p239/p239_126.wav|p239|Their season has been consigned to history.
DUMMY/p245/p245_254.wav|p245|they fail to engage.
DUMMY/p246/p246_035.wav|p246|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p226/p226_100.wav|p226|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY/p240/p240_276.wav|p240|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY/p227/p227_109.wav|p227|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p225/p225_266.wav|p225|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
DUMMY/p244/p244_376.wav|p244|You have to be patient.
DUMMY/p226/p226_143.wav|p226|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY/p238/p238_015.wav|p238|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p236/p236_376.wav|p236|All would be under threat.
DUMMY/p236/p236_059.wav|p236|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY/p239/p239_104.wav|p239|I am so proud of him.
DUMMY/p249/p249_064.wav|p249|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY/p247/p247_005.wav|p247|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
DUMMY/p249/p249_200.wav|p249|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY/p247/p247_337.wav|p247|We will listen to any suggestion.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_169.wav|p228|Eight months later, he was dead.
DUMMY/p246/p246_051.wav|p246|Every aspect of our play was first class.
DUMMY/p225/p225_172.wav|p225|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p234/p234_005.wav|p234|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p226/p226_189.wav|p226|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p240/p240_117.wav|p240|I joined a group.
DUMMY/p226/p226_358.wav|p226|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p230/p230_409.wav|p230|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY/p226/p226_009.wav|p226|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p248/p248_186.wav|p248|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p231/p231_137.wav|p231|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY/p227/p227_100.wav|p227|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY/p234/p234_286.wav|p234|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_024.wav|p225|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p248/p248_213.wav|p248|Twaddle is a case in point.
DUMMY/p225/p225_118.wav|p225|We suffered a lot for seven years.
DUMMY/p230/p230_027.wav|p230|He has the courage of the unaware.
DUMMY/p241/p241_297.wav|p241|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p225/p225_236.wav|p225|That will be the criteria for the future.
DUMMY/p243/p243_392.wav|p243|Five years ago its return was rejected.
DUMMY/p249/p249_179.wav|p249|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p238/p238_357.wav|p238|And the World Cup has not even begun.
DUMMY/p249/p249_045.wav|p249|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY/p239/p239_204.wav|p239|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY/p226/p226_332.wav|p226|I am so upset.
DUMMY/p232/p232_297.wav|p232|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY/p239/p239_329.wav|p239|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY/p248/p248_223.wav|p248|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY/p227/p227_212.wav|p227|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_076.wav|p246|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
DUMMY/p230/p230_186.wav|p230|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY/p247/p247_352.wav|p247|There was some merit in that.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_248.wav|p225|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_145.wav|p248|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY/p246/p246_167.wav|p246|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY/p232/p232_158.wav|p232|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p227/p227_177.wav|p227|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
DUMMY/p240/p240_316.wav|p240|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY/p245/p245_086.wav|p245|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY/p248/p248_332.wav|p248|It will be very, very tight.
DUMMY/p241/p241_092.wav|p241|Today I couldn't run on it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_183.wav|p231|The shooting created panic in the street.
DUMMY/p237/p237_194.wav|p237|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY/p247/p247_159.wav|p247|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_201.wav|p225|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
DUMMY/p232/p232_358.wav|p232|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY/p241/p241_336.wav|p241|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY/p243/p243_309.wav|p243|It happened on average once a week this year.
DUMMY/p246/p246_217.wav|p246|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p228/p228_354.wav|p228|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
DUMMY/p246/p246_123.wav|p246|I just wanted a break.
DUMMY/p226/p226_330.wav|p226|The weekly average was three hours.
DUMMY/p231/p231_023.wav|p231|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p229/p229_382.wav|p229|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY/p240/p240_180.wav|p240|They will run a mile.
DUMMY/p237/p237_141.wav|p237|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p231/p231_338.wav|p231|There was no time scale.
DUMMY/p239/p239_017.wav|p239|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p244/p244_400.wav|p244|It is the last meeting of the season.
DUMMY/p226/p226_102.wav|p226|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
DUMMY/p244/p244_239.wav|p244|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY/p243/p243_091.wav|p243|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
DUMMY/p229/p229_344.wav|p229|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY/p239/p239_070.wav|p239|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
DUMMY/p249/p249_096.wav|p249|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY/p229/p229_353.wav|p229|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY/p249/p249_204.wav|p249|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
DUMMY/p230/p230_304.wav|p230|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY/p239/p239_270.wav|p239|Harrowing is easy, after all.
DUMMY/p236/p236_108.wav|p236|Football is a passion for many.
DUMMY/p231/p231_094.wav|p231|You are like an animal.
DUMMY/p238/p238_317.wav|p238|Here the picture is broadly stable.
DUMMY/p225/p225_328.wav|p225|It is just a tax on employment.
DUMMY/p225/p225_061.wav|p225|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
DUMMY/p246/p246_042.wav|p246|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY/p231/p231_155.wav|p231|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY/p247/p247_176.wav|p247|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_060.wav|p243|It was a day she thought she would never see.
DUMMY/p241/p241_032.wav|p241|This is the window.
DUMMY/p229/p229_054.wav|p229|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY/p244/p244_294.wav|p244|We are in a war.
DUMMY/p243/p243_362.wav|p243|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY/p226/p226_299.wav|p226|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY/p238/p238_300.wav|p238|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_331.wav|p246|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
DUMMY/p237/p237_306.wav|p237|I was the sheep.
DUMMY/p249/p249_082.wav|p249|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p248/p248_220.wav|p248|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY/p240/p240_204.wav|p240|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY/p229/p229_248.wav|p229|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY/p228/p228_267.wav|p228|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY/p248/p248_031.wav|p248|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
DUMMY/p236/p236_214.wav|p236|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY/p227/p227_097.wav|p227|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY/p239/p239_302.wav|p239|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
DUMMY/p234/p234_313.wav|p234|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY/p229/p229_387.wav|p229|That team is due to be announced this morning.
DUMMY/p240/p240_358.wav|p240|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
DUMMY/p232/p232_367.wav|p232|He has seen the past.
DUMMY/p232/p232_102.wav|p232|It was a good performance.
DUMMY/p236/p236_395.wav|p236|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p249/p249_323.wav|p249|There was no time scale.
DUMMY/p245/p245_203.wav|p245|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p234/p234_015.wav|p234|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p238/p238_389.wav|p238|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
DUMMY/p243/p243_179.wav|p243|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY/p248/p248_133.wav|p248|It plans to return to this field.
DUMMY/p231/p231_254.wav|p231|No production contract is yet in sight.
DUMMY/p238/p238_180.wav|p238|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY/p239/p239_453.wav|p239|It seemed a logical expansion.
DUMMY/p227/p227_193.wav|p227|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY/p236/p236_358.wav|p236|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p239/p239_167.wav|p239|We have reacted well to each other.
DUMMY/p247/p247_110.wav|p247|Before the game we went for a pint.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_354.wav|p230|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY/p239/p239_130.wav|p239|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_417.wav|p236|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY/p248/p248_025.wav|p248|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY/p232/p232_313.wav|p232|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY/p239/p239_342.wav|p239|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY/p249/p249_203.wav|p249|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY/p241/p241_322.wav|p241|It is a strong case.
DUMMY/p239/p239_043.wav|p239|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
DUMMY/p238/p238_176.wav|p238|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
DUMMY/p230/p230_200.wav|p230|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY/p240/p240_348.wav|p240|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY/p228/p228_100.wav|p228|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY/p227/p227_107.wav|p227|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY/p231/p231_055.wav|p231|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY/p246/p246_319.wav|p246|They had a confession.
DUMMY/p227/p227_324.wav|p227|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY/p248/p248_254.wav|p248|We run within the law.
DUMMY/p248/p248_349.wav|p248|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
DUMMY/p227/p227_195.wav|p227|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY/p226/p226_230.wav|p226|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY/p230/p230_407.wav|p230|The casualties were not named.
DUMMY/p236/p236_318.wav|p236|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY/p244/p244_074.wav|p244|Only water is currently allowed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_032.wav|p238|The staff are very good.
DUMMY/p239/p239_487.wav|p239|It could well be military.
DUMMY/p248/p248_114.wav|p248|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY/p228/p228_362.wav|p228|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_372.wav|p236|We used to keep our business rates.
DUMMY/p229/p229_090.wav|p229|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p230/p230_269.wav|p230|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
DUMMY/p232/p232_051.wav|p232|Here's a clue.
DUMMY/p248/p248_246.wav|p248|The scene is about this?
DUMMY/p246/p246_070.wav|p246|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p237/p237_279.wav|p237|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY/p245/p245_358.wav|p245|He's very explosive.
DUMMY/p243/p243_284.wav|p243|The fans pay for their season tickets.
DUMMY/p231/p231_037.wav|p231|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p243/p243_146.wav|p243|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
DUMMY/p243/p243_098.wav|p243|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
DUMMY/p240/p240_184.wav|p240|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY/p245/p245_327.wav|p245|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY/p246/p246_207.wav|p246|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY/p246/p246_347.wav|p246|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
DUMMY/p236/p236_487.wav|p236|We have to go for a win.
DUMMY/p231/p231_145.wav|p231|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY/p244/p244_313.wav|p244|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY/p247/p247_289.wav|p247|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_014.wav|p225|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p226/p226_344.wav|p226|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY/p226/p226_318.wav|p226|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p243/p243_231.wav|p243|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
DUMMY/p228/p228_138.wav|p228|We had a reunion last week.
DUMMY/p246/p246_315.wav|p246|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p226/p226_084.wav|p226|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p236/p236_321.wav|p236|All winners should be tested.
DUMMY/p239/p239_450.wav|p239|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY/p228/p228_297.wav|p228|You are the glory.
DUMMY/p231/p231_110.wav|p231|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_341.wav|p246|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
DUMMY/p244/p244_044.wav|p244|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_040.wav|p229|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY/p227/p227_382.wav|p227|This will impact on us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_377.wav|p247|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_369.wav|p243|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
DUMMY/p239/p239_300.wav|p239|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
DUMMY/p241/p241_125.wav|p241|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY/p232/p232_234.wav|p232|But she was.
DUMMY/p230/p230_117.wav|p230|Which can happen any time.
DUMMY/p225/p225_090.wav|p225|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY/p238/p238_154.wav|p238|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY/p238/p238_414.wav|p238|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY/p230/p230_248.wav|p230|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p239/p239_451.wav|p239|Either way, it's very funny.
DUMMY/p239/p239_459.wav|p239|This is a great opportunity for us.
DUMMY/p245/p245_067.wav|p245|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p243/p243_356.wav|p243|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
DUMMY/p237/p237_110.wav|p237|Further protests are likely.
DUMMY/p247/p247_340.wav|p247|The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_345.wav|p244|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p228/p228_003.wav|p228|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p236/p236_466.wav|p236|The boys are mentally focused.
DUMMY/p230/p230_305.wav|p230|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY/p238/p238_020.wav|p238|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_263.wav|p239|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY/p241/p241_071.wav|p241|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY/p244/p244_389.wav|p244|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p238/p238_280.wav|p238|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY/p237/p237_031.wav|p237|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
DUMMY/p229/p229_380.wav|p229|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY/p225/p225_337.wav|p225|But they have the sound.
DUMMY/p236/p236_177.wav|p236|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_080.wav|p245|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY/p239/p239_102.wav|p239|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
DUMMY/p236/p236_300.wav|p236|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_380.wav|p239|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY/p225/p225_317.wav|p225|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY/p239/p239_233.wav|p239|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY/p247/p247_356.wav|p247|Other people had looked at it.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_228.wav|p229|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p236/p236_103.wav|p236|It's not a lack of effort.
DUMMY/p227/p227_158.wav|p227|It is difficult to say.
DUMMY/p248/p248_169.wav|p248|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY/p228/p228_149.wav|p228|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p232/p232_076.wav|p232|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY/p227/p227_214.wav|p227|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_315.wav|p240|It is no surprise.
DUMMY/p227/p227_051.wav|p227|The motive for the shooting was not known.
DUMMY/p230/p230_299.wav|p230|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p236/p236_014.wav|p236|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p226/p226_361.wav|p226|Our numbers are small.
DUMMY/p230/p230_295.wav|p230|It's got to come from me.
DUMMY/p240/p240_099.wav|p240|I see no need for change.
DUMMY/p248/p248_295.wav|p248|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
DUMMY/p245/p245_092.wav|p245|He's a star.
DUMMY/p247/p247_049.wav|p247|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_259.wav|p238|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
DUMMY/p232/p232_044.wav|p232|We will push.
DUMMY/p238/p238_097.wav|p238|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY/p245/p245_246.wav|p245|Her presence was almost everywhere.
DUMMY/p248/p248_016.wav|p248|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p243/p243_214.wav|p243|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
DUMMY/p234/p234_151.wav|p234|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_132.wav|p249|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
DUMMY/p248/p248_331.wav|p248|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY/p228/p228_111.wav|p228|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY/p240/p240_105.wav|p240|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY/p241/p241_115.wav|p241|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY/p240/p240_332.wav|p240|I am so upset.
DUMMY/p225/p225_022.wav|p225|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p230/p230_233.wav|p230|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
DUMMY/p247/p247_384.wav|p247|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_078.wav|p226|There could be a way back.
DUMMY/p249/p249_221.wav|p249|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY/p243/p243_025.wav|p243|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
DUMMY/p236/p236_411.wav|p236|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY/p245/p245_056.wav|p245|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY/p243/p243_050.wav|p243|Have I really come to this ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_077.wav|p244|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY/p239/p239_214.wav|p239|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
DUMMY/p248/p248_297.wav|p248|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY/p248/p248_185.wav|p248|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY/p230/p230_312.wav|p230|The songs are just so good.
DUMMY/p247/p247_125.wav|p247|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_061.wav|p237|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY/p230/p230_340.wav|p230|You may have a short memory.
DUMMY/p240/p240_249.wav|p240|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
DUMMY/p238/p238_423.wav|p238|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
DUMMY/p241/p241_056.wav|p241|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
DUMMY/p229/p229_204.wav|p229|Last night was a key episode.
DUMMY/p229/p229_328.wav|p229|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
DUMMY/p248/p248_142.wav|p248|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY/p240/p240_036.wav|p240|It is marvellous.
DUMMY/p237/p237_314.wav|p237|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY/p232/p232_335.wav|p232|She did not attend the courtroom.
DUMMY/p249/p249_192.wav|p249|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p238/p238_017.wav|p238|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p238/p238_226.wav|p238|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY/p240/p240_324.wav|p240|Craig is a major concern for us.
DUMMY/p231/p231_172.wav|p231|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_072.wav|p239|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY/p236/p236_231.wav|p236|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY/p247/p247_475.wav|p247|The chief constable has retired.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_139.wav|p232|I am totally devoted to this job.
DUMMY/p228/p228_144.wav|p228|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY/p248/p248_180.wav|p248|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p229/p229_362.wav|p229|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p226/p226_204.wav|p226|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY/p230/p230_189.wav|p230|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY/p231/p231_256.wav|p231|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY/p245/p245_111.wav|p245|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY/p230/p230_369.wav|p230|They have broken the promise.
DUMMY/p226/p226_350.wav|p226|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY/p230/p230_297.wav|p230|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
DUMMY/p246/p246_250.wav|p246|Is there on his hands?
DUMMY/p248/p248_040.wav|p248|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY/p237/p237_335.wav|p237|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY/p229/p229_237.wav|p229|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY/p229/p229_170.wav|p229|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
DUMMY/p245/p245_291.wav|p245|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY/p234/p234_271.wav|p234|Well, it was certainly different.
DUMMY/p237/p237_338.wav|p237|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
DUMMY/p231/p231_290.wav|p231|They were on holiday in Egypt.
DUMMY/p228/p228_036.wav|p228|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY/p240/p240_004.wav|p240|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p246/p246_064.wav|p246|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
DUMMY/p248/p248_034.wav|p248|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
DUMMY/p232/p232_269.wav|p232|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
DUMMY/p232/p232_332.wav|p232|Horses are drawn by ballot.
DUMMY/p248/p248_240.wav|p248|My future is in the marathon.
DUMMY/p241/p241_267.wav|p241|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY/p226/p226_331.wav|p226|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY/p243/p243_007.wav|p243|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p241/p241_148.wav|p241|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY/p246/p246_289.wav|p246|Dialogue is the key.
DUMMY/p246/p246_087.wav|p246|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY/p234/p234_205.wav|p234|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_124.wav|p249|Who would have?
DUMMY/p244/p244_401.wav|p244|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY/p227/p227_401.wav|p227|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_378.wav|p232|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
DUMMY/p240/p240_051.wav|p240|It's a blessing.
DUMMY/p241/p241_310.wav|p241|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY/p244/p244_262.wav|p244|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY/p247/p247_022.wav|p247|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY/p231/p231_390.wav|p231|It was fit for royalty.
DUMMY/p228/p228_042.wav|p228|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY/p238/p238_425.wav|p238|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY/p249/p249_100.wav|p249|We must look forward.
DUMMY/p244/p244_158.wav|p244|As for the warning, it was not needed.
DUMMY/p240/p240_013.wav|p240|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p236/p236_111.wav|p236|The result is a vacuum.
DUMMY/p230/p230_059.wav|p230|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY/p241/p241_106.wav|p241|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_310.wav|p231|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY/p230/p230_194.wav|p230|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY/p238/p238_275.wav|p238|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
DUMMY/p232/p232_173.wav|p232|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p236/p236_309.wav|p236|I am a retailer by nature.
DUMMY/p241/p241_284.wav|p241|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY/p227/p227_391.wav|p227|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY/p237/p237_303.wav|p237|Who can predict ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_477.wav|p236|Analysts said the offer was fair.
DUMMY/p228/p228_295.wav|p228|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY/p238/p238_373.wav|p238|But you never won any games.
DUMMY/p226/p226_323.wav|p226|He said she was mad.
DUMMY/p247/p247_098.wav|p247|He had missed a penalty against the English.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_205.wav|p229|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY/p234/p234_069.wav|p234|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
DUMMY/p243/p243_383.wav|p243|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY/p227/p227_132.wav|p227|I felt he was excellent.
DUMMY/p231/p231_474.wav|p231|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY/p226/p226_085.wav|p226|It can be halted.
DUMMY/p226/p226_060.wav|p226|It is unique.
DUMMY/p239/p239_341.wav|p239|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY/p226/p226_098.wav|p226|If you could find it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_150.wav|p245|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
DUMMY/p244/p244_095.wav|p244|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY/p249/p249_277.wav|p249|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY/p245/p245_217.wav|p245|I can't wait to meet him.
DUMMY/p248/p248_360.wav|p248|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY/p241/p241_270.wav|p241|Access has been a nightmare.
DUMMY/p236/p236_306.wav|p236|Maloney is an engaging talent.
DUMMY/p225/p225_332.wav|p225|It's difficult to predict the future.
DUMMY/p229/p229_377.wav|p229|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_396.wav|p239|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY/p229/p229_222.wav|p229|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY/p231/p231_420.wav|p231|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY/p243/p243_196.wav|p243|was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_179.wav|p244|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
DUMMY/p232/p232_180.wav|p232|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY/p238/p238_065.wav|p238|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
DUMMY/p243/p243_263.wav|p243|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.

DUMMY/p238/p238_021.wav|p238|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.

DUMMY/p240/p240_351.wav|p240|Look at the witnesses.

DUMMY/p244/p244_338.wav|p244|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.

DUMMY/p247/p247_104.wav|p247|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_501.wav|p236|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.

DUMMY/p236/p236_463.wav|p236|Not if you know the person.
DUMMY/p228/p228_264.wav|p228|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
DUMMY/p228/p228_059.wav|p228|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY/p228/p228_207.wav|p228|Ferguson should take note.

DUMMY/p247/p247_317.wav|p247|He was obviously very genuine.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_389.wav|p231|That time may never be broken.
DUMMY/p243/p243_319.wav|p243|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
DUMMY/p237/p237_123.wav|p237|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p243/p243_166.wav|p243|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
DUMMY/p231/p231_167.wav|p231|It is simply not true.
DUMMY/p248/p248_343.wav|p248|It is horrible.

DUMMY/p231/p231_100.wav|p231|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY/p237/p237_182.wav|p237|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p245/p245_352.wav|p245|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
DUMMY/p246/p246_351.wav|p246|I was in the train station overnight.

DUMMY/p243/p243_071.wav|p243|It turned me against the whole system.
DUMMY/p240/p240_086.wav|p240|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p244/p244_342.wav|p244|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.

DUMMY/p231/p231_352.wav|p231|So what happens next ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_092.wav|p239|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_287.wav|p228|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
DUMMY/p244/p244_251.wav|p244|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
DUMMY/p249/p249_078.wav|p249|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY/p247/p247_026.wav|p247|Meetings will also remain private.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_049.wav|p234|Part of the complex is historic.
DUMMY/p247/p247_044.wav|p247|Merger would be entirely logical.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_075.wav|p238|The wingers must have felt the cold.
DUMMY/p246/p246_171.wav|p246|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p249/p249_094.wav|p249|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p232/p232_215.wav|p232|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p238/p238_200.wav|p238|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_014.wav|p238|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p246/p246_342.wav|p246|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY/p231/p231_107.wav|p231|And does it ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_102.wav|p240|He takes the job.
DUMMY/p245/p245_347.wav|p245|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p237/p237_311.wav|p237|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
DUMMY/p238/p238_206.wav|p238|Truth is the child of time.
DUMMY/p239/p239_288.wav|p239|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY/p248/p248_326.wav|p248|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY/p240/p240_377.wav|p240|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY/p247/p247_304.wav|p247|He will address the nation this evening.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_035.wav|p249|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p237/p237_048.wav|p237|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY/p227/p227_024.wav|p227|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p227/p227_171.wav|p227|The people are the hero.
DUMMY/p230/p230_314.wav|p230|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_212.wav|p241|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
DUMMY/p230/p230_204.wav|p230|This is a holy place.
DUMMY/p229/p229_250.wav|p229|It's only fair.
DUMMY/p245/p245_304.wav|p245|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY/p225/p225_315.wav|p225|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY/p230/p230_300.wav|p230|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p243/p243_365.wav|p243|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
DUMMY/p236/p236_322.wav|p236|I can live with it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_036.wav|p237|They're just different.
DUMMY/p243/p243_305.wav|p243|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_164.wav|p234|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p228/p228_041.wav|p228|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY/p225/p225_298.wav|p225|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p238/p238_311.wav|p238|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
DUMMY/p230/p230_347.wav|p230|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY/p234/p234_273.wav|p234|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY/p249/p249_304.wav|p249|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY/p247/p247_318.wav|p247|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_260.wav|p227|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
DUMMY/p229/p229_349.wav|p229|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
DUMMY/p232/p232_331.wav|p232|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p249/p249_117.wav|p249|It's a long process.
DUMMY/p231/p231_393.wav|p231|But we are very near.
DUMMY/p243/p243_038.wav|p243|He added that her comments were noted.
DUMMY/p234/p234_342.wav|p234|We did something about it.
DUMMY/p249/p249_109.wav|p249|It is a good day for the coalition.
DUMMY/p243/p243_388.wav|p243|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
DUMMY/p227/p227_017.wav|p227|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p239/p239_482.wav|p239|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY/p231/p231_161.wav|p231|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_289.wav|p243|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
DUMMY/p230/p230_196.wav|p230|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
DUMMY/p239/p239_082.wav|p239|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
DUMMY/p227/p227_022.wav|p227|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p241/p241_208.wav|p241|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_064.wav|p240|Art is extra.
DUMMY/p241/p241_312.wav|p241|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p238/p238_172.wav|p238|We continue to hold the shares.
DUMMY/p238/p238_432.wav|p238|It was like the old days.
DUMMY/p236/p236_329.wav|p236|I am not obsessed with sex.
DUMMY/p226/p226_115.wav|p226|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
DUMMY/p246/p246_006.wav|p246|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p247/p247_298.wav|p247|They were worth the money.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_178.wav|p239|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_365.wav|p240|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p226/p226_197.wav|p226|There was no option.
DUMMY/p247/p247_425.wav|p247|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_087.wav|p247|I've had it for the exams.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_285.wav|p241|The death toll included five children.
DUMMY/p243/p243_265.wav|p243|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY/p228/p228_018.wav|p228|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.

DUMMY/p231/p231_450.wav|p231|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
DUMMY/p239/p239_426.wav|p239|It certainly feels that way.
DUMMY/p226/p226_334.wav|p226|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY/p243/p243_316.wav|p243|A report on their property is due within days.
DUMMY/p244/p244_013.wav|p244|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p240/p240_087.wav|p240|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY/p236/p236_280.wav|p236|It has all been done in secret.
DUMMY/p232/p232_149.wav|p232|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p226/p226_181.wav|p226|I've been there.
DUMMY/p234/p234_253.wav|p234|It was just another play.
DUMMY/p241/p241_177.wav|p241|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY/p231/p231_119.wav|p231|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p247/p247_040.wav|p247|It is serious - but not that serious.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_253.wav|p248|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY/p237/p237_098.wav|p237|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY/p226/p226_192.wav|p226|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p231/p231_081.wav|p231|On Saturday, it was much the same.
DUMMY/p248/p248_093.wav|p248|He was possessed
DUMMY/p245/p245_224.wav|p245|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY/p244/p244_252.wav|p244|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY/p244/p244_022.wav|p244|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p246/p246_011.wav|p246|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_368.wav|p244|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p226/p226_048.wav|p226|It's a blessing.
DUMMY/p247/p247_307.wav|p247|But it has been an amazing experience.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_079.wav|p246|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p240/p240_188.wav|p240|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY/p236/p236_194.wav|p236|I had too much to drink.
DUMMY/p247/p247_152.wav|p247|What do we want to do that for ?)
DUMMY/p246/p246_256.wav|p246|They must play for each other.
DUMMY/p231/p231_165.wav|p231|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p245/p245_252.wav|p245|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
DUMMY/p234/p234_037.wav|p234|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY/p236/p236_221.wav|p236|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY/p238/p238_167.wav|p238|We can't get over it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_042.wav|p238|We want to get back into the Champions League.
DUMMY/p247/p247_395.wav|p247|He took over our lives.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_123.wav|p227|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_145.wav|p245|It has to be now.
DUMMY/p226/p226_289.wav|p226|This is a national crisis.
DUMMY/p243/p243_189.wav|p243|The story was not made public by this club.
DUMMY/p246/p246_260.wav|p246|There's not much money in cycling.
DUMMY/p247/p247_339.wav|p247|The election is total confusion and chaos.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_296.wav|p226|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY/p236/p236_202.wav|p236|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY/p241/p241_287.wav|p241|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY/p247/p247_260.wav|p247|We have no information on Iraq.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_089.wav|p227|You might not make it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_143.wav|p228|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY/p236/p236_488.wav|p236|It worked well in Monaco.
DUMMY/p229/p229_100.wav|p229|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
DUMMY/p239/p239_477.wav|p239|We did something about it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_192.wav|p227|They were seriously after him.
DUMMY/p236/p236_296.wav|p236|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY/p240/p240_293.wav|p240|It was a virus.
DUMMY/p249/p249_212.wav|p249|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY/p232/p232_013.wav|p232|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p243/p243_340.wav|p243|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_262.wav|p237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY/p226/p226_008.wav|p226|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p237/p237_230.wav|p237|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY/p230/p230_240.wav|p230|They need to win a trophy.
DUMMY/p244/p244_012.wav|p244|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p246/p246_105.wav|p246|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY/p236/p236_249.wav|p236|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_020.wav|p248|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_051.wav|p226|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY/p244/p244_126.wav|p244|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
DUMMY/p244/p244_145.wav|p244|Actors like to be in the centre.
DUMMY/p249/p249_060.wav|p249|That's the truth.
DUMMY/p230/p230_247.wav|p230|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY/p236/p236_191.wav|p236|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY/p229/p229_249.wav|p229|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY/p227/p227_041.wav|p227|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p245/p245_064.wav|p245|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p247/p247_123.wav|p247|It isn't a happy memory.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_151.wav|p239|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY/p227/p227_399.wav|p227|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_234.wav|p231|It is set in Paris.
DUMMY/p238/p238_289.wav|p238|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
DUMMY/p248/p248_306.wav|p248|It's about my time as a guitarist.
DUMMY/p230/p230_064.wav|p230|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
DUMMY/p245/p245_046.wav|p245|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY/p243/p243_042.wav|p243|He does not even trust his own members.
DUMMY/p248/p248_072.wav|p248|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p231/p231_408.wav|p231|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p237/p237_156.wav|p237|It is huge.
DUMMY/p228/p228_222.wav|p228|It's been a good year.
DUMMY/p249/p249_040.wav|p249|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY/p226/p226_326.wav|p226|The airport was even different.
DUMMY/p230/p230_263.wav|p230|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY/p226/p226_328.wav|p226|That's the law of the land.
DUMMY/p241/p241_166.wav|p241|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY/p236/p236_100.wav|p236|Our house was very small.
DUMMY/p243/p243_117.wav|p243|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_166.wav|p247|It has become a way of life.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_241.wav|p239|These days are long gone.
DUMMY/p227/p227_035.wav|p227|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY/p238/p238_178.wav|p238|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY/p249/p249_267.wav|p249|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY/p244/p244_215.wav|p244|A team is a team.
DUMMY/p244/p244_321.wav|p244|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY/p237/p237_268.wav|p237|That could be in place by next year.
DUMMY/p229/p229_139.wav|p229|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p241/p241_147.wav|p241|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p226/p226_355.wav|p226|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
DUMMY/p234/p234_336.wav|p234|This could be a mistake.
DUMMY/p227/p227_084.wav|p227|Potions said he would drive.
DUMMY/p226/p226_132.wav|p226|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
DUMMY/p243/p243_175.wav|p243|It didn't come as any great surprise.
DUMMY/p236/p236_416.wav|p236|I never had a childhood.
DUMMY/p249/p249_017.wav|p249|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p232/p232_230.wav|p232|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY/p231/p231_135.wav|p231|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY/p237/p237_050.wav|p237|It is bizarre.
DUMMY/p247/p247_346.wav|p247|Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
DUMMY/p239/p239_435.wav|p239|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p227/p227_277.wav|p227|I can't get a job.
DUMMY/p243/p243_001.wav|p243|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p239/p239_131.wav|p239|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_315.wav|p226|It was a question of patience.
DUMMY/p225/p225_127.wav|p225|It is a common problem.
DUMMY/p232/p232_365.wav|p232|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY/p229/p229_026.wav|p229|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY/p248/p248_153.wav|p248|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY/p226/p226_199.wav|p226|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY/p234/p234_335.wav|p234|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
DUMMY/p240/p240_129.wav|p240|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p249/p249_110.wav|p249|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p234/p234_354.wav|p234|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY/p249/p249_118.wav|p249|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY/p237/p237_291.wav|p237|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY/p248/p248_027.wav|p248|But it failed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_009.wav|p229|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p225/p225_157.wav|p225|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY/p249/p249_112.wav|p249|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY/p230/p230_267.wav|p230|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p236/p236_169.wav|p236|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY/p234/p234_031.wav|p234|It is on the internet.
DUMMY/p232/p232_150.wav|p232|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY/p246/p246_230.wav|p246|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY/p246/p246_185.wav|p246|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_077.wav|p229|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY/p249/p249_225.wav|p249|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p226/p226_024.wav|p226|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p247/p247_162.wav|p247|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_033.wav|p229|And we have a singer.
DUMMY/p248/p248_241.wav|p248|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY/p244/p244_038.wav|p244|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p248/p248_362.wav|p248|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY/p226/p226_074.wav|p226|You need a trademark.
DUMMY/p249/p249_095.wav|p249|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY/p238/p238_215.wav|p238|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
DUMMY/p228/p228_101.wav|p228|I love the Dome.
DUMMY/p249/p249_101.wav|p249|It is an old family habit.
DUMMY/p248/p248_184.wav|p248|They receive a high profile in the media.
DUMMY/p228/p228_054.wav|p228|It had been in place since last July.
DUMMY/p238/p238_212.wav|p238|It is time for confession.
DUMMY/p244/p244_281.wav|p244|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY/p237/p237_180.wav|p237|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY/p249/p249_037.wav|p249|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY/p232/p232_371.wav|p232|The scene is about this ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_270.wav|p244|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
DUMMY/p249/p249_186.wav|p249|It should be easy.
DUMMY/p231/p231_414.wav|p231|They are looking for profit.
DUMMY/p227/p227_111.wav|p227|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
DUMMY/p244/p244_257.wav|p244|It was really good in the first week.
DUMMY/p249/p249_114.wav|p249|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY/p229/p229_343.wav|p229|These days are long gone.
DUMMY/p229/p229_087.wav|p229|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY/p243/p243_223.wav|p243|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
DUMMY/p231/p231_260.wav|p231|The concerns are the same.
DUMMY/p234/p234_208.wav|p234|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_065.wav|p244|That is all in the past.
DUMMY/p226/p226_001.wav|p226|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p245/p245_001.wav|p245|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p228/p228_068.wav|p228|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_335.wav|p225|We are in the end game.
DUMMY/p237/p237_140.wav|p237|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY/p245/p245_167.wav|p245|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY/p237/p237_047.wav|p237|It is urgent.
DUMMY/p229/p229_337.wav|p229|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY/p231/p231_185.wav|p231|As many as the market will support.
DUMMY/p241/p241_094.wav|p241|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
DUMMY/p226/p226_088.wav|p226|Detection is often difficult.
DUMMY/p240/p240_320.wav|p240|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p227/p227_255.wav|p227|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY/p241/p241_370.wav|p241|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY/p241/p241_025.wav|p241|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY/p230/p230_129.wav|p230|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY/p229/p229_326.wav|p229|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY/p228/p228_228.wav|p228|It is a gamble.
DUMMY/p238/p238_293.wav|p238|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
DUMMY/p243/p243_364.wav|p243|Both players gave so much to the side.
DUMMY/p231/p231_097.wav|p231|We should recognise others have done a good job.
DUMMY/p245/p245_066.wav|p245|You need a trademark.
DUMMY/p225/p225_103.wav|p225|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
DUMMY/p246/p246_298.wav|p246|And huge, indeed, it is.
DUMMY/p231/p231_147.wav|p231|The whole industry is a shambles.
DUMMY/p241/p241_130.wav|p241|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY/p236/p236_317.wav|p236|That is the real test.
DUMMY/p243/p243_370.wav|p243|I have come here to show support for the families.
DUMMY/p225/p225_151.wav|p225|Nothing has been put into action.
DUMMY/p232/p232_258.wav|p232|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
DUMMY/p240/p240_125.wav|p240|I was furious.
DUMMY/p245/p245_337.wav|p245|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
DUMMY/p237/p237_272.wav|p237|This is a big club.
DUMMY/p238/p238_312.wav|p238|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY/p238/p238_064.wav|p238|He will need that machine.
DUMMY/p229/p229_110.wav|p229|I'm not depressed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_279.wav|p238|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY/p234/p234_153.wav|p234|That is the nature of the game.
DUMMY/p243/p243_346.wav|p243|It was a bit like having children.
DUMMY/p229/p229_129.wav|p229|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p230/p230_087.wav|p230|It was not an insult.
DUMMY/p229/p229_060.wav|p229|And a film maker was born.
DUMMY/p238/p238_326.wav|p238|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
DUMMY/p245/p245_122.wav|p245|What will happen then?
DUMMY/p227/p227_074.wav|p227|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p226/p226_255.wav|p226|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY/p245/p245_355.wav|p245|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
DUMMY/p230/p230_278.wav|p230|None of this work is guaranteed.
DUMMY/p248/p248_044.wav|p248|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY/p246/p246_332.wav|p246|This is the last straw.
DUMMY/p230/p230_115.wav|p230|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY/p228/p228_253.wav|p228|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
DUMMY/p226/p226_339.wav|p226|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY/p232/p232_192.wav|p232|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY/p236/p236_462.wav|p236|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
DUMMY/p243/p243_253.wav|p243|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
DUMMY/p232/p232_260.wav|p232|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
DUMMY/p240/p240_190.wav|p240|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
DUMMY/p231/p231_203.wav|p231|What are you no good at ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_011.wav|p231|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_325.wav|p238|Their conclusions were never published.
DUMMY/p243/p243_287.wav|p243|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
DUMMY/p234/p234_075.wav|p234|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
DUMMY/p228/p228_293.wav|p228|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p232/p232_322.wav|p232|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY/p227/p227_133.wav|p227|They could use a boost.
DUMMY/p234/p234_223.wav|p234|He must have a crack at it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_441.wav|p231|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY/p236/p236_464.wav|p236|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY/p240/p240_193.wav|p240|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY/p239/p239_013.wav|p239|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p226/p226_062.wav|p226|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY/p244/p244_335.wav|p244|And it's a goodbye from him.
DUMMY/p239/p239_197.wav|p239|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY/p230/p230_360.wav|p230|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
DUMMY/p231/p231_344.wav|p231|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p239/p239_339.wav|p239|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY/p241/p241_294.wav|p241|What has altered?
DUMMY/p230/p230_266.wav|p230|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY/p246/p246_189.wav|p246|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
DUMMY/p244/p244_235.wav|p244|We have to win the group.
DUMMY/p238/p238_183.wav|p238|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY/p239/p239_334.wav|p239|Royal Bank declined to comment.
DUMMY/p225/p225_122.wav|p225|I didn't feel under any pressure.
DUMMY/p229/p229_201.wav|p229|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY/p238/p238_290.wav|p238|We've just had it confirmed.
DUMMY/p245/p245_228.wav|p245|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY/p228/p228_052.wav|p228|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p234/p234_196.wav|p234|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY/p249/p249_012.wav|p249|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p232/p232_248.wav|p232|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY/p239/p239_402.wav|p239|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY/p244/p244_219.wav|p244|THE force is with them.
DUMMY/p247/p247_215.wav|p247|And they were being paid ?)
DUMMY/p239/p239_187.wav|p239|This is a frightening development.
DUMMY/p225/p225_235.wav|p225|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
DUMMY/p246/p246_182.wav|p246|Does this matter?
DUMMY/p236/p236_310.wav|p236|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY/p249/p249_270.wav|p249|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY/p227/p227_105.wav|p227|Such actions are rarely popular.
DUMMY/p230/p230_125.wav|p230|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p229/p229_366.wav|p229|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY/p237/p237_277.wav|p237|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p244/p244_103.wav|p244|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
DUMMY/p243/p243_298.wav|p243|It is based on population rather than need.
DUMMY/p225/p225_001.wav|p225|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p244/p244_333.wav|p244|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_074.wav|p231|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY/p229/p229_126.wav|p229|Who would be a referee ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_218.wav|p243|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY/p246/p246_279.wav|p246|It is so very obvious.
DUMMY/p240/p240_343.wav|p240|It is a sign of hope.
DUMMY/p228/p228_288.wav|p228|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p230/p230_280.wav|p230|We're trying to get rounded performers.
DUMMY/p237/p237_286.wav|p237|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY/p232/p232_213.wav|p232|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY/p243/p243_012.wav|p243|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p241/p241_266.wav|p241|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY/p244/p244_340.wav|p244|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
DUMMY/p248/p248_273.wav|p248|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p245/p245_331.wav|p245|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY/p243/p243_065.wav|p243|Indeed he has a lot of output.
DUMMY/p239/p239_182.wav|p239|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_332.wav|p249|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p237/p237_249.wav|p237|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY/p247/p247_230.wav|p247|William Hague delighted his party.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_269.wav|p243|They always want to give a performance.
DUMMY/p230/p230_006.wav|p230|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_005.wav|p249|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p237/p237_256.wav|p237|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
DUMMY/p244/p244_261.wav|p244|But it was a loss.
DUMMY/p232/p232_178.wav|p232|It's the real thing, for sure.
DUMMY/p225/p225_010.wav|p225|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_058.wav|p245|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p230/p230_414.wav|p230|It is the old story.
DUMMY/p225/p225_254.wav|p225|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY/p225/p225_264.wav|p225|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
DUMMY/p247/p247_052.wav|p247|The couple actually came upon the accident.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_404.wav|p232|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY/p232/p232_350.wav|p232|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p225/p225_359.wav|p225|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY/p245/p245_333.wav|p245|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY/p238/p238_159.wav|p238|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
DUMMY/p239/p239_440.wav|p239|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p236/p236_452.wav|p236|It is a cause for concern.
DUMMY/p246/p246_241.wav|p246|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY/p226/p226_335.wav|p226|The boat was fantastic.
DUMMY/p230/p230_104.wav|p230|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
DUMMY/p228/p228_296.wav|p228|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p237/p237_326.wav|p237|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY/p249/p249_252.wav|p249|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
DUMMY/p246/p246_234.wav|p246|You should be.
DUMMY/p236/p236_272.wav|p236|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY/p249/p249_329.wav|p249|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p247/p247_431.wav|p247|No date has been fixed for his return.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_131.wav|p236|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY/p231/p231_108.wav|p231|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p244/p244_280.wav|p244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY/p241/p241_230.wav|p241|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY/p231/p231_224.wav|p231|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
DUMMY/p247/p247_405.wav|p247|The Cabinet is split over the issue.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_303.wav|p231|I was just so determined.
DUMMY/p249/p249_349.wav|p249|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY/p249/p249_319.wav|p249|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY/p241/p241_371.wav|p241|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY/p243/p243_137.wav|p243|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
DUMMY/p243/p243_222.wav|p243|We are still seeking that complete performance.
DUMMY/p236/p236_174.wav|p236|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_333.wav|p247|The people will not be patient.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_137.wav|p240|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY/p229/p229_199.wav|p229|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_213.wav|p243|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
DUMMY/p227/p227_198.wav|p227|If the director is with you.
DUMMY/p238/p238_031.wav|p238|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p239/p239_207.wav|p239|We are now working with full-time on future product.
DUMMY/p239/p239_256.wav|p239|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY/p240/p240_310.wav|p240|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY/p244/p244_377.wav|p244|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
DUMMY/p230/p230_237.wav|p230|Must have been at the bar.
DUMMY/p247/p247_459.wav|p247|The damage is all inside.)
DUMMY/p232/p232_059.wav|p232|That's the truth.
DUMMY/p239/p239_489.wav|p239|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
DUMMY/p230/p230_209.wav|p230|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
DUMMY/p240/p240_168.wav|p240|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p232/p232_057.wav|p232|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
DUMMY/p241/p241_305.wav|p241|And he goes with it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_023.wav|p245|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_418.wav|p238|We have no information on Iraq.
DUMMY/p234/p234_280.wav|p234|It depends on Labour, not on us.
DUMMY/p247/p247_030.wav|p247|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_332.wav|p230|I can see their argument.
DUMMY/p236/p236_027.wav|p236|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY/p228/p228_029.wav|p228|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY/p226/p226_002.wav|p226|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p226/p226_037.wav|p226|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
DUMMY/p238/p238_370.wav|p238|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
DUMMY/p231/p231_036.wav|p231|But he can turn on the charm.
DUMMY/p245/p245_264.wav|p245|It left me with a sadness.
DUMMY/p232/p232_409.wav|p232|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY/p247/p247_127.wav|p247|I can't even get into the A team.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_460.wav|p238|It is business as usual.
DUMMY/p226/p226_031.wav|p226|This is the window.
DUMMY/p227/p227_365.wav|p227|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_320.wav|p231|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p230/p230_002.wav|p230|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p230/p230_416.wav|p230|No date has been set for a meeting.
DUMMY/p227/p227_398.wav|p227|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_107.wav|p240|It's in his blood.
DUMMY/p244/p244_331.wav|p244|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_359.wav|p246|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY/p239/p239_491.wav|p239|It's unlikely to be renewed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_332.wav|p243|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
DUMMY/p243/p243_113.wav|p243|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_384.wav|p227|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p238/p238_012.wav|p238|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p238/p238_038.wav|p238|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
DUMMY/p229/p229_287.wav|p229|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY/p243/p243_160.wav|p243|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY/p230/p230_010.wav|p230|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_129.wav|p239|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_220.wav|p227|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY/p229/p229_047.wav|p229|But it is all by design.
DUMMY/p245/p245_088.wav|p245|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY/p246/p246_052.wav|p246|Here's a clue.
DUMMY/p248/p248_012.wav|p248|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p245/p245_235.wav|p245|He says that he is no different from any other man.
DUMMY/p231/p231_173.wav|p231|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY/p232/p232_373.wav|p232|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
DUMMY/p228/p228_292.wav|p228|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY/p245/p245_286.wav|p245|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY/p240/p240_223.wav|p240|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY/p234/p234_169.wav|p234|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p244/p244_138.wav|p244|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_233.wav|p226|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
DUMMY/p229/p229_313.wav|p229|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY/p237/p237_200.wav|p237|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY/p234/p234_068.wav|p234|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY/p237/p237_173.wav|p237|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY/p234/p234_250.wav|p234|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p246/p246_055.wav|p246|It is unique.
DUMMY/p249/p249_088.wav|p249|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY/p241/p241_302.wav|p241|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY/p240/p240_355.wav|p240|This is a friendly match?
DUMMY/p243/p243_058.wav|p243|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p244/p244_212.wav|p244|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
DUMMY/p226/p226_103.wav|p226|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY/p248/p248_294.wav|p248|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p247/p247_107.wav|p247|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_093.wav|p238|He seems to have everything.
DUMMY/p246/p246_295.wav|p246|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY/p244/p244_168.wav|p244|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p244/p244_124.wav|p244|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY/p231/p231_118.wav|p231|Then again, we could have.
DUMMY/p240/p240_149.wav|p240|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p236/p236_308.wav|p236|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY/p231/p231_325.wav|p231|Have a look at this lot.
DUMMY/p241/p241_368.wav|p241|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY/p227/p227_148.wav|p227|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p239/p239_350.wav|p239|Translation - we got it wrong.
DUMMY/p236/p236_288.wav|p236|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
DUMMY/p243/p243_031.wav|p243|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
DUMMY/p234/p234_213.wav|p234|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY/p231/p231_469.wav|p231|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
DUMMY/p227/p227_254.wav|p227|It is a court case.
DUMMY/p236/p236_422.wav|p236|The fate of the rest is unknown.
DUMMY/p228/p228_209.wav|p228|Who will pay for this ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_469.wav|p239|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p228/p228_260.wav|p228|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
DUMMY/p231/p231_318.wav|p231|That meant the search was unlawful.
DUMMY/p237/p237_058.wav|p237|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p229/p229_285.wav|p229|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY/p247/p247_185.wav|p247|City sentiment is in his favour.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_278.wav|p228|All options are open.
DUMMY/p245/p245_258.wav|p245|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY/p227/p227_354.wav|p227|Whether this return was too soon.
DUMMY/p244/p244_233.wav|p244|There is a lot of concern.
DUMMY/p245/p245_323.wav|p245|I saw some good things.
DUMMY/p241/p241_154.wav|p241|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
DUMMY/p236/p236_297.wav|p236|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_227.wav|p243|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
DUMMY/p248/p248_243.wav|p248|She is well balanced.
DUMMY/p244/p244_207.wav|p244|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY/p249/p249_162.wav|p249|Neither side can win this war.
DUMMY/p240/p240_299.wav|p240|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p237/p237_348.wav|p237|Look at the witnesses.
DUMMY/p249/p249_301.wav|p249|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p239/p239_262.wav|p239|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
DUMMY/p245/p245_309.wav|p245|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY/p232/p232_063.wav|p232|You do not change overnight.
DUMMY/p228/p228_330.wav|p228|It is so unfair.
DUMMY/p241/p241_272.wav|p241|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY/p227/p227_350.wav|p227|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY/p248/p248_347.wav|p248|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p249/p249_249.wav|p249|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p247/p247_084.wav|p247|The party is up for it.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_239.wav|p225|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
DUMMY/p247/p247_004.wav|p247|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
DUMMY/p239/p239_436.wav|p239|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
DUMMY/p228/p228_244.wav|p228|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
DUMMY/p248/p248_257.wav|p248|They are real.
DUMMY/p241/p241_362.wav|p241|This is a club on the rise.
DUMMY/p239/p239_257.wav|p239|We have a budget in March.
DUMMY/p247/p247_073.wav|p247|Robin Williams is very subdued.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_053.wav|p227|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p244/p244_300.wav|p244|Scotland won by six wickets.
DUMMY/p240/p240_035.wav|p240|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY/p229/p229_161.wav|p229|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p232/p232_252.wav|p232|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
DUMMY/p243/p243_003.wav|p243|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p248/p248_078.wav|p248|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p241/p241_163.wav|p241|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
DUMMY/p244/p244_282.wav|p244|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY/p247/p247_267.wav|p247|There will be widespread support on all sides.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_302.wav|p243|And does it ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_068.wav|p232|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p237/p237_247.wav|p237|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY/p227/p227_353.wav|p227|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY/p247/p247_400.wav|p247|That investment has now been secured.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_163.wav|p236|Seven people were later detained by police.
DUMMY/p241/p241_111.wav|p241|It's not a new concept in jazz.
DUMMY/p228/p228_213.wav|p228|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
DUMMY/p238/p238_175.wav|p238|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p231/p231_029.wav|p231|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
DUMMY/p247/p247_430.wav|p247|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_017.wav|p236|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p248/p248_195.wav|p248|It wasn't to be.
DUMMY/p227/p227_010.wav|p227|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p230/p230_055.wav|p230|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
DUMMY/p228/p228_303.wav|p228|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY/p236/p236_114.wav|p236|The hearing was due to continue today.
DUMMY/p231/p231_380.wav|p231|We will win the argument.
DUMMY/p248/p248_287.wav|p248|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p245/p245_267.wav|p245|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY/p241/p241_021.wav|p241|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p231/p231_266.wav|p231|Is it in the right place ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_364.wav|p228|It is a simple equation.
DUMMY/p225/p225_029.wav|p225|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_226.wav|p239|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY/p238/p238_127.wav|p238|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
DUMMY/p232/p232_085.wav|p232|It's all going to clear the debt.
DUMMY/p239/p239_336.wav|p239|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
DUMMY/p232/p232_287.wav|p232|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY/p239/p239_367.wav|p239|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY/p244/p244_224.wav|p244|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY/p240/p240_121.wav|p240|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p229/p229_188.wav|p229|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
DUMMY/p227/p227_147.wav|p227|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY/p234/p234_200.wav|p234|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY/p225/p225_300.wav|p225|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_119.wav|p239|The Festival is prepared to help.
DUMMY/p247/p247_134.wav|p247|But it could be a consequence of our policy.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_457.wav|p247|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_338.wav|p245|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p238/p238_001.wav|p238|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p229/p229_083.wav|p229|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p234/p234_033.wav|p234|This is a central issue.
DUMMY/p238/p238_336.wav|p238|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_333.wav|p241|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p239/p239_424.wav|p239|The capital costs are modest.
DUMMY/p248/p248_181.wav|p248|The goals were good.
DUMMY/p243/p243_083.wav|p243|That kind of growth is the important thing.
DUMMY/p236/p236_256.wav|p236|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY/p248/p248_086.wav|p248|It's never too late.
DUMMY/p234/p234_302.wav|p234|But it was also hard.
DUMMY/p243/p243_188.wav|p243|I didn't miss the big house at all.
DUMMY/p236/p236_223.wav|p236|They are looking at a flotation.
DUMMY/p239/p239_206.wav|p239|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY/p240/p240_044.wav|p240|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY/p238/p238_449.wav|p238|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
DUMMY/p248/p248_197.wav|p248|It's the same old story.
DUMMY/p227/p227_396.wav|p227|It is a terrible equation.
DUMMY/p228/p228_333.wav|p228|I've got no secret.
DUMMY/p244/p244_076.wav|p244|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY/p227/p227_380.wav|p227|We are still getting over it.
DUMMY/p230/p230_255.wav|p230|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY/p247/p247_188.wav|p247|Talks are at an advanced stage.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_434.wav|p236|But you can go beyond that condition.
DUMMY/p236/p236_328.wav|p236|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY/p227/p227_071.wav|p227|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p238/p238_340.wav|p238|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
DUMMY/p230/p230_375.wav|p230|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY/p243/p243_043.wav|p243|He too started on the subs seats.
DUMMY/p246/p246_157.wav|p246|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
DUMMY/p228/p228_140.wav|p228|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
DUMMY/p239/p239_344.wav|p239|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY/p249/p249_025.wav|p249|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
DUMMY/p244/p244_386.wav|p244|An announcement is expected this week.
DUMMY/p243/p243_028.wav|p243|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
DUMMY/p234/p234_147.wav|p234|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY/p247/p247_423.wav|p247|That's been all around Europe with me.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_322.wav|p228|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY/p226/p226_292.wav|p226|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY/p225/p225_353.wav|p225|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
DUMMY/p232/p232_172.wav|p232|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY/p234/p234_083.wav|p234|They were badly prepared for it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_467.wav|p247|They're just a good retailer.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_011.wav|p236|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_204.wav|p244|It is not an issue.
DUMMY/p226/p226_027.wav|p226|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY/p240/p240_272.wav|p240|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY/p236/p236_230.wav|p236|I had relied on him.
DUMMY/p240/p240_327.wav|p240|Referees are easy targets.
DUMMY/p226/p226_012.wav|p226|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p226/p226_164.wav|p226|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p245/p245_044.wav|p245|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY/p247/p247_041.wav|p247|The boy is no longer with us.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_173.wav|p226|His team management was protective.
DUMMY/p247/p247_238.wav|p247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_058.wav|p234|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p239/p239_229.wav|p239|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
DUMMY/p231/p231_308.wav|p231|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY/p238/p238_372.wav|p238|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY/p237/p237_148.wav|p237|He is severe.
DUMMY/p232/p232_283.wav|p232|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY/p247/p247_258.wav|p247|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_114.wav|p234|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
DUMMY/p236/p236_081.wav|p236|We have turned the corner.
DUMMY/p246/p246_285.wav|p246|But I've won both ways.
DUMMY/p240/p240_022.wav|p240|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p247/p247_389.wav|p247|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_272.wav|p246|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
DUMMY/p247/p247_415.wav|p247|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_352.wav|p238|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_164.wav|p232|That must be left to the Parole Board.
DUMMY/p232/p232_137.wav|p232|The goals were good.
DUMMY/p248/p248_026.wav|p248|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
DUMMY/p232/p232_184.wav|p232|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p246/p246_324.wav|p246|Either team will be hard.
DUMMY/p232/p232_366.wav|p232|It benefits the whole family.
DUMMY/p231/p231_246.wav|p231|His is a global perspective.
DUMMY/p241/p241_051.wav|p241|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p230/p230_408.wav|p230|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
DUMMY/p248/p248_164.wav|p248|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p231/p231_004.wav|p231|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p234/p234_274.wav|p234|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY/p237/p237_132.wav|p237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
DUMMY/p237/p237_251.wav|p237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY/p245/p245_166.wav|p245|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY/p249/p249_102.wav|p249|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
DUMMY/p247/p247_306.wav|p247|Motherwell have no such good fortune.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_338.wav|p247|It was an achievement all right.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_408.wav|p247|But they can also be managed by telephone.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_396.wav|p238|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY/p228/p228_133.wav|p228|This plan is an agenda for action.
DUMMY/p229/p229_082.wav|p229|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY/p245/p245_354.wav|p245|It was very formal.
DUMMY/p236/p236_112.wav|p236|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
DUMMY/p249/p249_011.wav|p249|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p225/p225_166.wav|p225|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
DUMMY/p249/p249_089.wav|p249|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p247/p247_380.wav|p247|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_481.wav|p236|He will be advised by me.
DUMMY/p245/p245_104.wav|p245|I'm delighted about that.
DUMMY/p236/p236_342.wav|p236|It was almost too much.
DUMMY/p239/p239_427.wav|p239|This idea has been around for four years.
DUMMY/p225/p225_293.wav|p225|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY/p231/p231_033.wav|p231|It carried a double message.
DUMMY/p227/p227_043.wav|p227|I'd come back from London.
DUMMY/p249/p249_330.wav|p249|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY/p230/p230_070.wav|p230|It looks like a hit.
DUMMY/p241/p241_074.wav|p241|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY/p234/p234_297.wav|p234|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
DUMMY/p225/p225_290.wav|p225|Scotch beef is badly missed.
DUMMY/p236/p236_029.wav|p236|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
DUMMY/p239/p239_475.wav|p239|I am sorry, but I forgot.
DUMMY/p236/p236_370.wav|p236|They will fight for everything.
DUMMY/p248/p248_081.wav|p248|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY/p234/p234_127.wav|p234|However, it was a different story in the final.
DUMMY/p240/p240_112.wav|p240|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
DUMMY/p239/p239_410.wav|p239|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY/p241/p241_132.wav|p241|What will happen then?
DUMMY/p229/p229_259.wav|p229|This is a big club.
DUMMY/p241/p241_070.wav|p241|The company yesterday refused to comment.
DUMMY/p231/p231_270.wav|p231|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY/p230/p230_063.wav|p230|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY/p237/p237_039.wav|p237|The problem is the pitch.
DUMMY/p227/p227_003.wav|p227|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p226/p226_284.wav|p226|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY/p236/p236_090.wav|p236|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_037.wav|p243|That was not perfect golf by any means.
DUMMY/p226/p226_160.wav|p226|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p228/p228_172.wav|p228|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p226/p226_174.wav|p226|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY/p234/p234_043.wav|p234|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY/p248/p248_144.wav|p248|He is severe.
DUMMY/p236/p236_089.wav|p236|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_393.wav|p230|Motion described it as a unique event.
DUMMY/p229/p229_117.wav|p229|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY/p249/p249_076.wav|p249|The play is based on a real-life event.
DUMMY/p246/p246_022.wav|p246|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p236/p236_324.wav|p236|And he goes with it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_113.wav|p227|However, we have to be cautious.
DUMMY/p239/p239_371.wav|p239|He ended up a headmaster.
DUMMY/p246/p246_312.wav|p246|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY/p232/p232_194.wav|p232|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY/p234/p234_234.wav|p234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
DUMMY/p243/p243_236.wav|p243|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY/p239/p239_209.wav|p239|He is a very talented player.
DUMMY/p227/p227_392.wav|p227|That's not like us at all.
DUMMY/p238/p238_438.wav|p238|We discovered that for ourselves.
DUMMY/p239/p239_073.wav|p239|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
DUMMY/p229/p229_022.wav|p229|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p246/p246_330.wav|p246|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY/p225/p225_082.wav|p225|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY/p239/p239_001.wav|p239|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p231/p231_269.wav|p231|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p228/p228_154.wav|p228|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY/p237/p237_077.wav|p237|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p244/p244_120.wav|p244|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY/p240/p240_301.wav|p240|A new school will be built.
DUMMY/p234/p234_003.wav|p234|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p239/p239_276.wav|p239|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
DUMMY/p230/p230_293.wav|p230|I would rather look at him.
DUMMY/p231/p231_144.wav|p231|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p234/p234_048.wav|p234|It is all starting to come together.
DUMMY/p238/p238_459.wav|p238|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
DUMMY/p239/p239_099.wav|p239|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p239/p239_381.wav|p239|We have not been approached.
DUMMY/p247/p247_305.wav|p247|Tony Blair said as little.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_308.wav|p238|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY/p241/p241_123.wav|p241|I'm so angry.
DUMMY/p247/p247_320.wav|p247|I first met him last summer.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_282.wav|p237|This is a question of Islam.
DUMMY/p238/p238_371.wav|p238|We will likely look for new investors.
DUMMY/p238/p238_071.wav|p238|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY/p225/p225_133.wav|p225|I think he's the favourite.
DUMMY/p240/p240_290.wav|p240|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY/p236/p236_355.wav|p236|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_195.wav|p234|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY/p236/p236_018.wav|p236|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p227/p227_343.wav|p227|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
DUMMY/p226/p226_131.wav|p226|I was furious.
DUMMY/p239/p239_086.wav|p239|Or so the theory goes.
DUMMY/p230/p230_337.wav|p230|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_351.wav|p248|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p249/p249_243.wav|p249|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY/p241/p241_061.wav|p241|It was all in a short period of time.
DUMMY/p244/p244_018.wav|p244|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p231/p231_236.wav|p231|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY/p246/p246_154.wav|p246|She had gone to the Catholic school.
DUMMY/p243/p243_109.wav|p243|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
DUMMY/p236/p236_257.wav|p236|I was just a kid.
DUMMY/p243/p243_084.wav|p243|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
DUMMY/p248/p248_060.wav|p248|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p236/p236_449.wav|p236|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY/p229/p229_211.wav|p229|It's the same old story.
DUMMY/p239/p239_502.wav|p239|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY/p240/p240_073.wav|p240|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY/p244/p244_160.wav|p244|We want to get there.
DUMMY/p234/p234_137.wav|p234|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_074.wav|p240|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p229/p229_076.wav|p229|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_198.wav|p237|If the director is with you.
DUMMY/p245/p245_120.wav|p245|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY/p238/p238_086.wav|p238|We should all be grateful.
DUMMY/p247/p247_372.wav|p247|He had no previous convictions.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_008.wav|p227|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p246/p246_008.wav|p246|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p229/p229_065.wav|p229|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p248/p248_365.wav|p248|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY/p239/p239_483.wav|p239|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
DUMMY/p240/p240_313.wav|p240|And he goes with it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_063.wav|p245|He was popular.
DUMMY/p248/p248_149.wav|p248|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
DUMMY/p229/p229_238.wav|p229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY/p228/p228_012.wav|p228|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p234/p234_344.wav|p234|We do not have the papers.
DUMMY/p241/p241_354.wav|p241|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY/p231/p231_370.wav|p231|This is a major championship.
DUMMY/p236/p236_132.wav|p236|They could use a boost.
DUMMY/p236/p236_274.wav|p236|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY/p232/p232_401.wav|p232|It is legally binding.
DUMMY/p241/p241_110.wav|p241|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY/p245/p245_342.wav|p245|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY/p236/p236_193.wav|p236|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY/p247/p247_141.wav|p247|They made such decisions in London.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_158.wav|p246|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY/p247/p247_416.wav|p247|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_338.wav|p243|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_204.wav|p245|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY/p229/p229_034.wav|p229|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY/p238/p238_283.wav|p238|Phase one was a shambles.
DUMMY/p247/p247_273.wav|p247|Is our children learning ?)
DUMMY/p244/p244_364.wav|p244|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
DUMMY/p247/p247_109.wav|p247|The following are the principal provisions.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_152.wav|p239|Since then, things have improved.
DUMMY/p232/p232_030.wav|p232|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p231/p231_279.wav|p231|At first I thought I was gone.
DUMMY/p232/p232_163.wav|p232|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY/p243/p243_345.wav|p243|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY/p227/p227_096.wav|p227|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY/p239/p239_046.wav|p239|But not a penny has been paid.
DUMMY/p238/p238_335.wav|p238|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY/p237/p237_137.wav|p237|It's perfectly feasible.
DUMMY/p248/p248_329.wav|p248|He has to learn.
DUMMY/p240/p240_370.wav|p240|Hartley should know.
DUMMY/p240/p240_109.wav|p240|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY/p232/p232_001.wav|p232|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p234/p234_317.wav|p234|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
DUMMY/p236/p236_314.wav|p236|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY/p232/p232_080.wav|p232|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY/p244/p244_299.wav|p244|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_150.wav|p234|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY/p226/p226_295.wav|p226|He should have won.
DUMMY/p226/p226_200.wav|p226|Is that success?
DUMMY/p226/p226_159.wav|p226|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY/p249/p249_142.wav|p249|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p238/p238_349.wav|p238|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY/p228/p228_164.wav|p228|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
DUMMY/p245/p245_261.wav|p245|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY/p234/p234_154.wav|p234|There is a spring in the step.
DUMMY/p229/p229_035.wav|p229|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p227/p227_374.wav|p227|It has been made to entertain.
DUMMY/p236/p236_085.wav|p236|Change will however have to be in euros.
DUMMY/p239/p239_169.wav|p239|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
DUMMY/p232/p232_023.wav|p232|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_275.wav|p249|People have no choice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_254.wav|p228|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
DUMMY/p246/p246_084.wav|p246|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p236/p236_241.wav|p236|They said that they stood by their statement.
DUMMY/p227/p227_101.wav|p227|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
DUMMY/p228/p228_184.wav|p228|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p246/p246_116.wav|p246|Who would have?
DUMMY/p231/p231_467.wav|p231|Classes must be reduced by half.
DUMMY/p239/p239_346.wav|p239|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY/p229/p229_316.wav|p229|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY/p240/p240_227.wav|p240|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY/p236/p236_454.wav|p236|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY/p238/p238_218.wav|p238|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY/p228/p228_053.wav|p228|Here's a clue.
DUMMY/p230/p230_121.wav|p230|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY/p228/p228_182.wav|p228|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY/p229/p229_294.wav|p229|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
DUMMY/p229/p229_360.wav|p229|It was very formal.
DUMMY/p246/p246_226.wav|p246|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY/p231/p231_071.wav|p231|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY/p234/p234_172.wav|p234|I have had a good life.
DUMMY/p247/p247_369.wav|p247|It is a stroke of genius.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_030.wav|p230|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p237/p237_073.wav|p237|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p228/p228_302.wav|p228|Is there on his hands ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_143.wav|p238|But it looks good for next year.
DUMMY/p236/p236_224.wav|p236|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY/p240/p240_262.wav|p240|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
DUMMY/p241/p241_373.wav|p241|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY/p245/p245_271.wav|p245|She looked so young.
DUMMY/p232/p232_093.wav|p232|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p227/p227_239.wav|p227|There is a world of difference.
DUMMY/p240/p240_070.wav|p240|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
DUMMY/p225/p225_356.wav|p225|I said he was set to retire.
DUMMY/p229/p229_280.wav|p229|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY/p234/p234_235.wav|p234|The conference is the first test.
DUMMY/p240/p240_282.wav|p240|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY/p248/p248_278.wav|p248|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
DUMMY/p232/p232_104.wav|p232|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
DUMMY/p247/p247_276.wav|p247|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_135.wav|p243|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
DUMMY/p225/p225_038.wav|p225|Diving is no part of football.
DUMMY/p238/p238_104.wav|p238|That would be the case with Dundee.
DUMMY/p245/p245_146.wav|p245|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p229/p229_373.wav|p229|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY/p246/p246_145.wav|p246|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY/p231/p231_470.wav|p231|It is too early to speculate.
DUMMY/p236/p236_348.wav|p236|The confidence isn't there now.
DUMMY/p225/p225_303.wav|p225|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY/p234/p234_156.wav|p234|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
DUMMY/p245/p245_172.wav|p245|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
DUMMY/p246/p246_237.wav|p246|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
DUMMY/p246/p246_283.wav|p246|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY/p240/p240_280.wav|p240|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY/p230/p230_333.wav|p230|After some discussion they did.
DUMMY/p240/p240_029.wav|p240|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p236/p236_043.wav|p236|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY/p243/p243_361.wav|p243|The institute board will take the decision.
DUMMY/p226/p226_261.wav|p226|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p241/p241_044.wav|p241|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p240/p240_008.wav|p240|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p240/p240_295.wav|p240|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY/p227/p227_125.wav|p227|You've got to be vigilant.
DUMMY/p226/p226_303.wav|p226|One was a lawyer.
DUMMY/p244/p244_227.wav|p244|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY/p249/p249_086.wav|p249|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p227/p227_249.wav|p227|It is possible to be too good.
DUMMY/p238/p238_231.wav|p238|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY/p232/p232_289.wav|p232|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
DUMMY/p249/p249_120.wav|p249|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p240/p240_337.wav|p240|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p241/p241_283.wav|p241|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p234/p234_255.wav|p234|The world is a good place.
DUMMY/p245/p245_297.wav|p245|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
DUMMY/p243/p243_358.wav|p243|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY/p232/p232_179.wav|p232|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p230/p230_370.wav|p230|We are really good friends.
DUMMY/p234/p234_165.wav|p234|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY/p249/p249_083.wav|p249|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p248/p248_207.wav|p248|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY/p246/p246_231.wav|p246|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
DUMMY/p230/p230_143.wav|p230|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p247/p247_037.wav|p247|The ambition this year is to improve on last.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_418.wav|p239|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p228/p228_049.wav|p228|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p231/p231_158.wav|p231|It is not like us.
DUMMY/p229/p229_304.wav|p229|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY/p239/p239_006.wav|p239|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p230/p230_077.wav|p230|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
DUMMY/p249/p249_123.wav|p249|They've got to account for it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_056.wav|p228|That's the day job.
DUMMY/p227/p227_379.wav|p227|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
DUMMY/p226/p226_209.wav|p226|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY/p243/p243_217.wav|p243|I do not see this so much as failure.
DUMMY/p247/p247_316.wav|p247|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_268.wav|p248|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY/p232/p232_193.wav|p232|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY/p228/p228_280.wav|p228|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY/p225/p225_152.wav|p225|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p240/p240_170.wav|p240|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
DUMMY/p237/p237_221.wav|p237|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY/p248/p248_281.wav|p248|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p248/p248_286.wav|p248|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
DUMMY/p236/p236_287.wav|p236|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY/p244/p244_037.wav|p244|History is in the making.
DUMMY/p228/p228_023.wav|p228|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_375.wav|p243|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
DUMMY/p232/p232_174.wav|p232|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY/p237/p237_085.wav|p237|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p245/p245_069.wav|p245|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY/p244/p244_238.wav|p244|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p226/p226_036.wav|p226|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
DUMMY/p237/p237_246.wav|p237|They should come forward.
DUMMY/p238/p238_142.wav|p238|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY/p245/p245_273.wav|p245|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
DUMMY/p238/p238_254.wav|p238|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_046.wav|p225|No details of the talks were given.
DUMMY/p229/p229_330.wav|p229|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p236/p236_251.wav|p236|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY/p238/p238_197.wav|p238|His words were not audible.
DUMMY/p225/p225_355.wav|p225|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
DUMMY/p232/p232_237.wav|p232|However, no further action was taken by police.
DUMMY/p227/p227_377.wav|p227|It was forced to divert.
DUMMY/p245/p245_185.wav|p245|He's not perfect.
DUMMY/p244/p244_323.wav|p244|But it is up again.
DUMMY/p232/p232_231.wav|p232|I'd never seen a play about me.
DUMMY/p227/p227_302.wav|p227|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
DUMMY/p241/p241_248.wav|p241|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
DUMMY/p247/p247_088.wav|p247|Those people must be accountable.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_061.wav|p245|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
DUMMY/p231/p231_351.wav|p231|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_291.wav|p232|They were also beside themselves.
DUMMY/p243/p243_337.wav|p243|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_397.wav|p230|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_192.wav|p244|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_088.wav|p227|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY/p249/p249_353.wav|p249|I kept going for her.
DUMMY/p240/p240_155.wav|p240|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY/p229/p229_341.wav|p229|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
DUMMY/p238/p238_006.wav|p238|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_343.wav|p243|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
DUMMY/p239/p239_449.wav|p239|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY/p234/p234_278.wav|p234|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
DUMMY/p239/p239_153.wav|p239|That's what happened against Ayr.
DUMMY/p227/p227_106.wav|p227|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY/p248/p248_199.wav|p248|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY/p246/p246_195.wav|p246|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY/p243/p243_288.wav|p243|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
DUMMY/p237/p237_154.wav|p237|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY/p236/p236_480.wav|p236|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY/p239/p239_181.wav|p239|Did it work ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_290.wav|p237|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
DUMMY/p237/p237_285.wav|p237|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY/p245/p245_202.wav|p245|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p241/p241_064.wav|p241|The script was funny.
DUMMY/p245/p245_173.wav|p245|We must keep our feet on the ground.
DUMMY/p247/p247_345.wav|p247|Is there a waiting list ?)
DUMMY/p226/p226_342.wav|p226|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY/p236/p236_407.wav|p236|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY/p249/p249_006.wav|p249|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p234/p234_219.wav|p234|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
DUMMY/p248/p248_201.wav|p248|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
DUMMY/p243/p243_153.wav|p243|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_176.wav|p240|They know no other way.
DUMMY/p246/p246_119.wav|p246|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p228/p228_064.wav|p228|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p238/p238_002.wav|p238|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p232/p232_142.wav|p232|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY/p238/p238_168.wav|p238|They almost achieved a draw.
DUMMY/p243/p243_280.wav|p243|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
DUMMY/p227/p227_154.wav|p227|The strong pound also took its toll.
DUMMY/p226/p226_149.wav|p226|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
DUMMY/p236/p236_393.wav|p236|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
DUMMY/p227/p227_270.wav|p227|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_439.wav|p247|An alternative must be offered.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_063.wav|p231|What do we do ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_301.wav|p248|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
DUMMY/p247/p247_062.wav|p247|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY/p238/p238_088.wav|p238|It was exactly four months away.
DUMMY/p240/p240_077.wav|p240|Is there a new way forward?
DUMMY/p232/p232_243.wav|p232|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY/p248/p248_338.wav|p248|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY/p240/p240_174.wav|p240|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p243/p243_143.wav|p243|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
DUMMY/p249/p249_133.wav|p249|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p227/p227_112.wav|p227|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY/p225/p225_033.wav|p225|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.

DUMMY/p236/p236_460.wav|p236|The chief constable has retired.
DUMMY/p241/p241_029.wav|p241|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY/p234/p234_052.wav|p234|I was released after six days.
DUMMY/p229/p229_192.wav|p229|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p228/p228_185.wav|p228|I took the gun.
DUMMY/p237/p237_071.wav|p237|Try to save us.
DUMMY/p230/p230_110.wav|p230|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
DUMMY/p244/p244_288.wav|p244|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY/p237/p237_037.wav|p237|It was clear.
DUMMY/p236/p236_250.wav|p236|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
DUMMY/p249/p249_354.wav|p249|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p232/p232_330.wav|p232|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p239/p239_030.wav|p239|It is about control of our economy.
DUMMY/p249/p249_125.wav|p249|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p230/p230_073.wav|p230|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_447.wav|p231|We've got a good management record.
DUMMY/p226/p226_118.wav|p226|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
DUMMY/p243/p243_219.wav|p243|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.

DUMMY/p230/p230_226.wav|p230|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY/p229/p229_182.wav|p229|It is a memorial.
DUMMY/p246/p246_038.wav|p246|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
DUMMY/p229/p229_322.wav|p229|It should be equal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_341.wav|p244|However, a bid was never made.
DUMMY/p230/p230_413.wav|p230|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY/p241/p241_178.wav|p241|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p241/p241_040.wav|p241|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY/p238/p238_121.wav|p238|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_014.wav|p228|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p241/p241_286.wav|p241|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY/p243/p243_376.wav|p243|It used to be all hard sell.
DUMMY/p227/p227_205.wav|p227|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY/p236/p236_292.wav|p236|She failed in her action.
DUMMY/p244/p244_163.wav|p244|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY/p240/p240_116.wav|p240|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY/p248/p248_138.wav|p248|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p226/p226_111.wav|p226|It was an adventure.
DUMMY/p228/p228_232.wav|p228|We just had a go.
DUMMY/p231/p231_349.wav|p231|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_065.wav|p225|There is no pressure on us.
DUMMY/p241/p241_017.wav|p241|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p229/p229_070.wav|p229|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY/p234/p234_254.wav|p234|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY/p243/p243_100.wav|p243|I am delighted to hear this news.
DUMMY/p231/p231_407.wav|p231|There was an element of frustration.
DUMMY/p228/p228_304.wav|p228|It's not even finished.
DUMMY/p245/p245_356.wav|p245|It's not that clear-cut.
DUMMY/p237/p237_172.wav|p237|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY/p230/p230_400.wav|p230|It is a large number.
DUMMY/p248/p248_062.wav|p248|Four other charges were dropped.
DUMMY/p239/p239_045.wav|p239|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_023.wav|p240|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p244/p244_034.wav|p244|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
DUMMY/p231/p231_301.wav|p231|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
DUMMY/p246/p246_153.wav|p246|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY/p234/p234_222.wav|p234|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
DUMMY/p240/p240_177.wav|p240|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY/p229/p229_212.wav|p229|But we are not immune to the problem.
DUMMY/p226/p226_267.wav|p226|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
DUMMY/p227/p227_028.wav|p227|We will look into it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_061.wav|p229|Art is extra.
DUMMY/p238/p238_309.wav|p238|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY/p247/p247_089.wav|p247|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_283.wav|p245|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p244/p244_105.wav|p244|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY/p243/p243_066.wav|p243|Do not give your details to anyone.

DUMMY/p243/p243_202.wav|p243|I've never had a year like this.
DUMMY/p231/p231_375.wav|p231|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
DUMMY/p227/p227_025.wav|p227|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY/p239/p239_377.wav|p239|Commitment is released on Liberty.
DUMMY/p228/p228_306.wav|p228|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p237/p237_271.wav|p237|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
DUMMY/p249/p249_137.wav|p249|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
DUMMY/p247/p247_367.wav|p247|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_356.wav|p239|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_262.wav|p248|That is highly unfair.
DUMMY/p244/p244_298.wav|p244|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_357.wav|p230|The professor said the results were positive.
DUMMY/p238/p238_056.wav|p238|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_236.wav|p236|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY/p247/p247_353.wav|p247|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_219.wav|p240|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY/p225/p225_294.wav|p225|However, we had no failures in our side.
DUMMY/p239/p239_122.wav|p239|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
DUMMY/p238/p238_333.wav|p238|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY/p247/p247_373.wav|p247|Neither woman has been named.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_184.wav|p229|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY/p229/p229_288.wav|p229|I felt like I was a child.
DUMMY/p238/p238_390.wav|p238|It's difficult to put a date on.
DUMMY/p231/p231_430.wav|p231|It was a breathtaking moment.
DUMMY/p232/p232_171.wav|p232|My life has been destroyed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_050.wav|p238|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
DUMMY/p237/p237_219.wav|p237|I began to pray.
DUMMY/p244/p244_071.wav|p244|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY/p236/p236_404.wav|p236|I remain a buyer of the shares.
DUMMY/p230/p230_292.wav|p230|It is a recipe for success.
DUMMY/p239/p239_252.wav|p239|The strong performance is expected to continue.
DUMMY/p237/p237_107.wav|p237|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
DUMMY/p240/p240_338.wav|p240|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p239/p239_192.wav|p239|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY/p234/p234_182.wav|p234|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
DUMMY/p248/p248_228.wav|p248|But he failed to win the committee's support.
DUMMY/p240/p240_305.wav|p240|There was no hint of scandal.
DUMMY/p243/p243_041.wav|p243|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
DUMMY/p240/p240_083.wav|p240|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p244/p244_290.wav|p244|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p247/p247_138.wav|p247|We did what we had to do.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_327.wav|p236|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY/p238/p238_395.wav|p238|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p229/p229_289.wav|p229|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_119.wav|p241|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY/p230/p230_335.wav|p230|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_333.wav|p246|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY/p246/p246_020.wav|p246|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p237/p237_027.wav|p237|I have a theory.
DUMMY/p237/p237_020.wav|p237|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_192.wav|p238|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
DUMMY/p225/p225_066.wav|p225|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p234/p234_232.wav|p234|It is the strength of the school.
DUMMY/p238/p238_222.wav|p238|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY/p229/p229_006.wav|p229|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p239/p239_397.wav|p239|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
DUMMY/p231/p231_112.wav|p231|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY/p239/p239_248.wav|p239|Adams is surely worth a chance.
DUMMY/p239/p239_004.wav|p239|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p228/p228_327.wav|p228|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p230/p230_162.wav|p230|Had I heard ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_069.wav|p229|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY/p236/p236_219.wav|p236|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY/p247/p247_234.wav|p247|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_268.wav|p244|It has to be enforced.
DUMMY/p234/p234_251.wav|p234|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p234/p234_051.wav|p234|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
DUMMY/p248/p248_261.wav|p248|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
DUMMY/p245/p245_198.wav|p245|It's been a good year.
DUMMY/p234/p234_009.wav|p234|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p245/p245_289.wav|p245|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY/p247/p247_180.wav|p247|They could not match it.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_442.wav|p239|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
DUMMY/p239/p239_112.wav|p239|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
DUMMY/p245/p245_162.wav|p245|They will run a mile.
DUMMY/p248/p248_018.wav|p248|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p239/p239_025.wav|p239|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
DUMMY/p226/p226_139.wav|p226|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY/p248/p248_004.wav|p248|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p236/p236_414.wav|p236|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
DUMMY/p226/p226_360.wav|p226|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY/p232/p232_154.wav|p232|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY/p237/p237_307.wav|p237|Graeme was prepared.
DUMMY/p247/p247_376.wav|p247|That is a crazy situation.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_261.wav|p228|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY/p238/p238_078.wav|p238|No plans for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY/p241/p241_216.wav|p241|I was so nervous.
DUMMY/p240/p240_106.wav|p240|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
DUMMY/p237/p237_074.wav|p237|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p225/p225_225.wav|p225|It is good for our team.
DUMMY/p238/p238_036.wav|p238|Let there be no doubt about that.
DUMMY/p229/p229_134.wav|p229|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
DUMMY/p248/p248_174.wav|p248|The jury is still out.
DUMMY/p245/p245_269.wav|p245|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY/p243/p243_224.wav|p243|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
DUMMY/p249/p249_231.wav|p249|It is a gamble.
DUMMY/p229/p229_370.wav|p229|He could make it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_089.wav|p241|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY/p245/p245_029.wav|p245|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY/p241/p241_039.wav|p241|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY/p237/p237_188.wav|p237|Government will intervene.
DUMMY/p225/p225_141.wav|p225|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
DUMMY/p227/p227_168.wav|p227|Was it the wife ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_421.wav|p247|He seems to be used to the attention.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_364.wav|p239|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY/p229/p229_190.wav|p229|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p225/p225_169.wav|p225|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
DUMMY/p239/p239_138.wav|p239|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
DUMMY/p229/p229_127.wav|p229|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
DUMMY/p232/p232_266.wav|p232|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY/p230/p230_394.wav|p230|I had a fortunate war.
DUMMY/p229/p229_194.wav|p229|It is minute.
DUMMY/p244/p244_017.wav|p244|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p227/p227_279.wav|p227|On the contrary they stand to gain.
DUMMY/p231/p231_044.wav|p231|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
DUMMY/p247/p247_452.wav|p247|Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_323.wav|p236|A lot has been written.
DUMMY/p249/p249_071.wav|p249|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p226/p226_273.wav|p226|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY/p240/p240_085.wav|p240|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY/p238/p238_354.wav|p238|They're going to open in early summer.
DUMMY/p239/p239_173.wav|p239|She is in good spirits.
DUMMY/p232/p232_360.wav|p232|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY/p244/p244_136.wav|p244|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_082.wav|p248|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_291.wav|p231|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
DUMMY/p248/p248_080.wav|p248|It may well have been.
DUMMY/p243/p243_331.wav|p243|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
DUMMY/p244/p244_008.wav|p244|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p248/p248_188.wav|p248|What has caused the demise of singing?

DUMMY/p239/p239_048.wav|p239|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.

DUMMY/p246/p246_046.wav|p246|They said she was stable.
DUMMY/p245/p245_199.wav|p245|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY/p228/p228_113.wav|p228|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY/p249/p249_211.wav|p249|Ferguson should take note.
DUMMY/p243/p243_052.wav|p243|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY/p247/p247_365.wav|p247|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_030.wav|p225|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY/p231/p231_261.wav|p231|I can't get a job.

DUMMY/p237/p237_060.wav|p237|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
DUMMY/p227/p227_037.wav|p227|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p229/p229_164.wav|p229|I knew he was good.
DUMMY/p226/p226_186.wav|p226|It just came into my head that day.
DUMMY/p230/p230_188.wav|p230|He lives in a neighbouring village.
DUMMY/p234/p234_022.wav|p234|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p238/p238_273.wav|p238|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
DUMMY/p244/p244_176.wav|p244|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
DUMMY/p225/p225_084.wav|p225|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
DUMMY/p232/p232_015.wav|p232|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p234/p234_177.wav|p234|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY/p231/p231_027.wav|p231|Because we do not need it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_369.wav|p231|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
DUMMY/p249/p249_019.wav|p249|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p232/p232_140.wav|p232|He is severe.
DUMMY/p229/p229_179.wav|p229|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
DUMMY/p227/p227_387.wav|p227|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
DUMMY/p229/p229_055.wav|p229|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY/p241/p241_042.wav|p241|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p240/p240_002.wav|p240|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p247/p247_060.wav|p247|Do I have a favourite ?)
DUMMY/p227/p227_038.wav|p227|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY/p247/p247_375.wav|p247|They have broken that promise.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_154.wav|p247|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY/p239/p239_485.wav|p239|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY/p227/p227_308.wav|p227|He will address the nation this evening.
DUMMY/p226/p226_138.wav|p226|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
DUMMY/p239/p239_071.wav|p239|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY/p247/p247_466.wav|p247|I think it's a great system.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_349.wav|p237|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY/p244/p244_009.wav|p244|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p232/p232_041.wav|p232|I suspect the latter.
DUMMY/p249/p249_311.wav|p249|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY/p232/p232_138.wav|p232|What will happen then ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_359.wav|p238|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY/p249/p249_169.wav|p249|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
DUMMY/p239/p239_213.wav|p239|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
DUMMY/p228/p228_175.wav|p228|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
DUMMY/p228/p228_173.wav|p228|We have to sort it out ourselves.
DUMMY/p244/p244_053.wav|p244|Their campaign is in disarray.
DUMMY/p231/p231_132.wav|p231|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
DUMMY/p230/p230_206.wav|p230|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY/p230/p230_211.wav|p230|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY/p226/p226_156.wav|p226|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY/p228/p228_266.wav|p228|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY/p227/p227_265.wav|p227|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_136.wav|p239|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
DUMMY/p249/p249_173.wav|p249|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY/p240/p240_118.wav|p240|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
DUMMY/p248/p248_263.wav|p248|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY/p229/p229_078.wav|p229|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
DUMMY/p229/p229_386.wav|p229|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY/p231/p231_451.wav|p231|We went straight into the bedroom.
DUMMY/p234/p234_071.wav|p234|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY/p239/p239_221.wav|p239|I was caught out a little bit.
DUMMY/p239/p239_301.wav|p239|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
DUMMY/p248/p248_370.wav|p248|I am a wealthy person.
DUMMY/p237/p237_059.wav|p237|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY/p241/p241_062.wav|p241|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY/p239/p239_255.wav|p239|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
DUMMY/p246/p246_131.wav|p246|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p234/p234_163.wav|p234|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY/p241/p241_036.wav|p241|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p226/p226_249.wav|p226|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p239/p239_497.wav|p239|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY/p231/p231_140.wav|p231|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY/p246/p246_309.wav|p246|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY/p226/p226_093.wav|p226|It's never too late.
DUMMY/p226/p226_185.wav|p226|It is not fair.
DUMMY/p245/p245_234.wav|p245|It's only fair.
DUMMY/p245/p245_091.wav|p245|They were outside the circle.
DUMMY/p237/p237_094.wav|p237|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
DUMMY/p232/p232_299.wav|p232|He has retired.
DUMMY/p230/p230_092.wav|p230|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY/p243/p243_173.wav|p243|If successful, several records will be made.
DUMMY/p238/p238_337.wav|p238|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY/p246/p246_287.wav|p246|You feel very helpless.
DUMMY/p247/p247_437.wav|p247|We've made a couple of albums.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_113.wav|p249|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p232/p232_204.wav|p232|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
DUMMY/p248/p248_371.wav|p248|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
DUMMY/p229/p229_378.wav|p229|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY/p248/p248_337.wav|p248|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p246/p246_316.wav|p246|The election is total confusion and chaos.
DUMMY/p227/p227_357.wav|p227|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY/p249/p249_039.wav|p249|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY/p228/p228_016.wav|p228|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p247/p247_002.wav|p247|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
DUMMY/p241/p241_152.wav|p241|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY/p249/p249_328.wav|p249|My view has now completely changed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_010.wav|p226|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p226/p226_058.wav|p226|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY/p226/p226_316.wav|p226|The whole region is in shock.
DUMMY/p248/p248_087.wav|p248|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY/p227/p227_272.wav|p227|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p239/p239_290.wav|p239|It was a pre-emptive strike.
DUMMY/p231/p231_284.wav|p231|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY/p236/p236_129.wav|p236|Before it was an ordeal.
DUMMY/p243/p243_013.wav|p243|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p226/p226_082.wav|p226|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY/p236/p236_042.wav|p236|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY/p249/p249_266.wav|p249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY/p236/p236_200.wav|p236|I had a train to catch.
DUMMY/p245/p245_188.wav|p245|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY/p234/p234_016.wav|p234|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p237/p237_162.wav|p237|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY/p243/p243_270.wav|p243|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY/p238/p238_137.wav|p238|I won't make an official complaint.
DUMMY/p236/p236_498.wav|p236|I was ready for this.
DUMMY/p243/p243_275.wav|p243|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
DUMMY/p241/p241_242.wav|p241|In fact, we were all over the shop.
DUMMY/p227/p227_005.wav|p227|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p236/p236_147.wav|p236|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p247/p247_391.wav|p247|He will consult the right people.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_065.wav|p245|The script was funny.
DUMMY/p231/p231_267.wav|p231|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_306.wav|p243|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_268.wav|p245|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY/p234/p234_179.wav|p234|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY/p239/p239_281.wav|p239|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY/p243/p243_125.wav|p243|I think there's not much between them.
DUMMY/p238/p238_179.wav|p238|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p230/p230_047.wav|p230|I must take a seat.
DUMMY/p229/p229_264.wav|p229|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p229/p229_145.wav|p229|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p226/p226_165.wav|p226|We have to move forward.
DUMMY/p234/p234_074.wav|p234|We were under a bit of pressure.
DUMMY/p234/p234_281.wav|p234|I had to be into it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_232.wav|p244|Other villages were completely deserted.
DUMMY/p247/p247_427.wav|p247|My aim is a top six finish.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_163.wav|p245|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY/p227/p227_092.wav|p227|For once, you should believe the hype.
DUMMY/p243/p243_301.wav|p243|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_021.wav|p232|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p241/p241_004.wav|p241|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p239/p239_412.wav|p239|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY/p249/p249_226.wav|p249|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p244/p244_416.wav|p244|There is no need to panic.
DUMMY/p232/p232_379.wav|p232|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY/p238/p238_355.wav|p238|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p227/p227_199.wav|p227|He made no order on costs.
DUMMY/p249/p249_176.wav|p249|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
DUMMY/p240/p240_349.wav|p240|He has to learn.
DUMMY/p239/p239_033.wav|p239|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p230/p230_249.wav|p230|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
DUMMY/p236/p236_050.wav|p236|I haven't been ill at all.
DUMMY/p231/p231_012.wav|p231|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p248/p248_049.wav|p248|The record companies have gone through the floor.
DUMMY/p236/p236_052.wav|p236|That was the difference today.
DUMMY/p247/p247_190.wav|p247|The Royal Highland was no exception.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_343.wav|p246|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY/p249/p249_283.wav|p249|You've got to have both sides.
DUMMY/p234/p234_080.wav|p234|On the night, it was not enough.
DUMMY/p243/p243_022.wav|p243|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p243/p243_324.wav|p243|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p246/p246_107.wav|p246|Is that right?
DUMMY/p244/p244_387.wav|p244|He will be difficult to replace.
DUMMY/p238/p238_304.wav|p238|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_194.wav|p243|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
DUMMY/p237/p237_258.wav|p237|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
DUMMY/p230/p230_222.wav|p230|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_276.wav|p244|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
DUMMY/p240/p240_021.wav|p240|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p237/p237_119.wav|p237|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p236/p236_097.wav|p236|That time is not now, however.
DUMMY/p231/p231_201.wav|p231|Does the name matter ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_274.wav|p247|How independent is that ?)
DUMMY/p244/p244_205.wav|p244|They have to get that sorted.
DUMMY/p244/p244_002.wav|p244|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p226/p226_044.wav|p226|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
DUMMY/p231/p231_428.wav|p231|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY/p236/p236_232.wav|p236|I'm just a regular person.
DUMMY/p227/p227_065.wav|p227|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY/p230/p230_126.wav|p230|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
DUMMY/p239/p239_330.wav|p239|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_051.wav|p231|We keep an eye on it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_461.wav|p236|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
DUMMY/p238/p238_196.wav|p238|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY/p239/p239_191.wav|p239|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY/p239/p239_286.wav|p239|Aberdeen had little to offer.
DUMMY/p246/p246_311.wav|p246|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY/p228/p228_299.wav|p228|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
DUMMY/p243/p243_002.wav|p243|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p240/p240_039.wav|p240|They're just different.
DUMMY/p228/p228_367.wav|p228|By that time, however, it was already too late.
DUMMY/p229/p229_358.wav|p229|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY/p249/p249_350.wav|p249|It is horrible.
DUMMY/p228/p228_011.wav|p228|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p240/p240_175.wav|p240|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY/p248/p248_073.wav|p248|Neither it is.
DUMMY/p234/p234_028.wav|p234|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p231/p231_152.wav|p231|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
DUMMY/p246/p246_143.wav|p246|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY/p241/p241_247.wav|p241|There will be widespread support on all sides.
DUMMY/p244/p244_372.wav|p244|The news is not all bad.
DUMMY/p229/p229_191.wav|p229|It is the whole package.
DUMMY/p244/p244_249.wav|p244|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_015.wav|p228|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p243/p243_055.wav|p243|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
DUMMY/p245/p245_270.wav|p245|People have no choice.
DUMMY/p234/p234_262.wav|p234|His second was a beauty.
DUMMY/p229/p229_068.wav|p229|I was as strong as a horse.
DUMMY/p244/p244_307.wav|p244|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY/p236/p236_354.wav|p236|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_269.wav|p226|They are never here.
DUMMY/p238/p238_083.wav|p238|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
DUMMY/p238/p238_393.wav|p238|You will have seen the adverts.
DUMMY/p231/p231_168.wav|p231|Well, this article is a bit like that.
DUMMY/p232/p232_261.wav|p232|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY/p238/p238_286.wav|p238|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY/p230/p230_214.wav|p230|We used to live with dignity in our country.
DUMMY/p246/p246_299.wav|p246|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY/p240/p240_163.wav|p240|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
DUMMY/p229/p229_286.wav|p229|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY/p247/p247_322.wav|p247|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_108.wav|p244|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
DUMMY/p248/p248_008.wav|p248|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p241/p241_011.wav|p241|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p241/p241_114.wav|p241|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
DUMMY/p226/p226_061.wav|p226|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY/p230/p230_410.wav|p230|The second goal was superb.
DUMMY/p230/p230_205.wav|p230|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY/p243/p243_203.wav|p243|Full details are expected to be released in June.
DUMMY/p247/p247_319.wav|p247|His appeal is instantly understood.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_322.wav|p243|We will not simply hit these people.
DUMMY/p226/p226_294.wav|p226|The results are sometimes contentious.
DUMMY/p236/p236_235.wav|p236|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY/p226/p226_367.wav|p226|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY/p228/p228_328.wav|p228|It has moved on in the last week.
DUMMY/p236/p236_228.wav|p236|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY/p244/p244_159.wav|p244|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p232/p232_395.wav|p232|We're looking for justice.
DUMMY/p234/p234_290.wav|p234|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY/p246/p246_037.wav|p246|They're just different.
DUMMY/p231/p231_466.wav|p231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
DUMMY/p239/p239_455.wav|p239|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY/p227/p227_151.wav|p227|I was shaking on the blocks.
DUMMY/p248/p248_038.wav|p248|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY/p231/p231_073.wav|p231|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY/p226/p226_356.wav|p226|She is free.
DUMMY/p236/p236_013.wav|p236|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p248/p248_269.wav|p248|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY/p238/p238_374.wav|p238|It didn't matter who was in their way.
DUMMY/p240/p240_030.wav|p240|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
DUMMY/p225/p225_073.wav|p225|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_467.wav|p236|It can all be done over the phone.
DUMMY/p232/p232_199.wav|p232|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY/p241/p241_217.wav|p241|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
DUMMY/p246/p246_270.wav|p246|We're in shock.
DUMMY/p238/p238_433.wav|p238|They are interior designers and architects.
DUMMY/p243/p243_313.wav|p243|For that reason cover should not be given.
DUMMY/p246/p246_009.wav|p246|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p245/p245_300.wav|p245|It's just not funny!
DUMMY/p230/p230_345.wav|p230|The airport was even different.
DUMMY/p225/p225_120.wav|p225|The industry is not well organised.
DUMMY/p226/p226_278.wav|p226|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY/p228/p228_318.wav|p228|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p245/p245_312.wav|p245|They wanted the club to make money.
DUMMY/p244/p244_398.wav|p244|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY/p247/p247_248.wav|p247|Three weeks later, he resigned.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_183.wav|p237|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p239/p239_007.wav|p239|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p238/p238_301.wav|p238|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_308.wav|p225|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p226/p226_033.wav|p226|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
DUMMY/p248/p248_359.wav|p248|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY/p248/p248_251.wav|p248|This year I understood.
DUMMY/p247/p247_265.wav|p247|Washington is consumed by the crisis.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_269.wav|p236|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
DUMMY/p249/p249_063.wav|p249|I'm just enjoying every match.
DUMMY/p229/p229_384.wav|p229|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
DUMMY/p234/p234_181.wav|p234|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY/p231/p231_417.wav|p231|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
DUMMY/p230/p230_401.wav|p230|You will not feel a thing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_141.wav|p240|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY/p246/p246_003.wav|p246|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p236/p236_446.wav|p236|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
DUMMY/p245/p245_190.wav|p245|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY/p247/p247_392.wav|p247|Rugby has an extended run.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_165.wav|p225|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
DUMMY/p236/p236_047.wav|p236|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY/p245/p245_130.wav|p245|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY/p229/p229_391.wav|p229|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY/p243/p243_123.wav|p243|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY/p249/p249_248.wav|p249|I was shocked.
DUMMY/p226/p226_148.wav|p226|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY/p243/p243_247.wav|p243|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
DUMMY/p230/p230_118.wav|p230|It is too pretty, it is too small.
DUMMY/p248/p248_085.wav|p248|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p234/p234_328.wav|p234|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY/p246/p246_147.wav|p246|I am just trying to do my job.
DUMMY/p228/p228_035.wav|p228|It was clear.
DUMMY/p241/p241_326.wav|p241|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY/p249/p249_244.wav|p249|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
DUMMY/p227/p227_090.wav|p227|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY/p247/p247_012.wav|p247|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
DUMMY/p239/p239_437.wav|p239|Things are going to change over the next six months.
DUMMY/p244/p244_024.wav|p244|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p236/p236_410.wav|p236|He may have a point.
DUMMY/p234/p234_010.wav|p234|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p246/p246_179.wav|p246|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY/p247/p247_082.wav|p247|It happens on an annual basis.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_069.wav|p238|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p239/p239_498.wav|p239|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY/p234/p234_197.wav|p234|He has defended the system.
DUMMY/p248/p248_065.wav|p248|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p234/p234_145.wav|p234|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY/p241/p241_231.wav|p241|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
DUMMY/p232/p232_082.wav|p232|What has changed ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_195.wav|p229|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY/p232/p232_062.wav|p232|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p248/p248_123.wav|p248|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY/p236/p236_345.wav|p236|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY/p240/p240_230.wav|p240|It's so special.
DUMMY/p230/p230_277.wav|p230|It is also very valuable.
DUMMY/p238/p238_124.wav|p238|So what happens next ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_455.wav|p247|People are so negative about the whole business.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_053.wav|p229|A recording contract is on the horizon.
DUMMY/p232/p232_008.wav|p232|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p231/p231_343.wav|p231|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY/p248/p248_339.wav|p248|It's the last thing on my mind.
DUMMY/p238/p238_227.wav|p238|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY/p239/p239_291.wav|p239|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
DUMMY/p237/p237_026.wav|p237|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY/p230/p230_168.wav|p230|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY/p240/p240_380.wav|p240|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY/p239/p239_074.wav|p239|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
DUMMY/p231/p231_184.wav|p231|So many people will be affected by this.
DUMMY/p247/p247_328.wav|p247|We believe the world has too many refugees already.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_357.wav|p243|It is the only natural British site on the list.
DUMMY/p238/p238_198.wav|p238|You are a gambling man.
DUMMY/p244/p244_417.wav|p244|It had been on the cards.
DUMMY/p249/p249_004.wav|p249|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p241/p241_261.wav|p241|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY/p243/p243_398.wav|p243|People have a wish to charge twice.
DUMMY/p244/p244_231.wav|p244|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p230/p230_387.wav|p230|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY/p230/p230_390.wav|p230|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
DUMMY/p246/p246_349.wav|p246|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p229/p229_295.wav|p229|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY/p243/p243_014.wav|p243|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p244/p244_211.wav|p244|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY/p232/p232_200.wav|p232|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
DUMMY/p247/p247_225.wav|p247|I am considered a teenager.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_152.wav|p236|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY/p229/p229_036.wav|p229|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY/p232/p232_074.wav|p232|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p246/p246_335.wav|p246|He loved the moment.
DUMMY/p241/p241_046.wav|p241|That time has passed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_107.wav|p243|They are a different team at home.
DUMMY/p241/p241_063.wav|p241|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
DUMMY/p237/p237_144.wav|p237|It seems so long since I did the exams.
DUMMY/p236/p236_155.wav|p236|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
DUMMY/p244/p244_328.wav|p244|Another difference is the cost.
DUMMY/p238/p238_225.wav|p238|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY/p240/p240_307.wav|p240|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
DUMMY/p241/p241_144.wav|p241|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY/p244/p244_140.wav|p244|Are you from the rugby ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_331.wav|p234|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p249/p249_339.wav|p249|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY/p249/p249_180.wav|p249|I always felt they played for me.
DUMMY/p247/p247_406.wav|p247|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_215.wav|p239|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY/p240/p240_243.wav|p240|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY/p246/p246_248.wav|p246|There's the mix.
DUMMY/p243/p243_062.wav|p243|The referee is there to decide these things.
DUMMY/p236/p236_227.wav|p236|That might help a bit.
DUMMY/p228/p228_188.wav|p228|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY/p232/p232_124.wav|p232|That's all right then.
DUMMY/p239/p239_335.wav|p239|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY/p238/p238_306.wav|p238|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
DUMMY/p238/p238_096.wav|p238|He was at home with his pals.
DUMMY/p239/p239_156.wav|p239|It is a good lifestyle.
DUMMY/p228/p228_204.wav|p228|Is that success ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_156.wav|p245|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p243/p243_207.wav|p243|I want an answer from the British Government.
DUMMY/p248/p248_324.wav|p248|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY/p241/p241_292.wav|p241|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY/p238/p238_191.wav|p238|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
DUMMY/p237/p237_017.wav|p237|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p244/p244_269.wav|p244|The party has never fully recovered.
DUMMY/p234/p234_029.wav|p234|However, the following year the cancer returned.
DUMMY/p243/p243_350.wav|p243|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
DUMMY/p245/p245_129.wav|p245|That group reported just before Christmas.
DUMMY/p228/p228_291.wav|p228|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
DUMMY/p229/p229_142.wav|p229|What will happen then ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_369.wav|p232|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
DUMMY/p246/p246_235.wav|p246|It's quite nice.
DUMMY/p238/p238_208.wav|p238|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY/p240/p240_148.wav|p240|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY/p247/p247_464.wav|p247|I'm very passionate about my country.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_059.wav|p245|There will be tough opponents to this report.
DUMMY/p229/p229_156.wav|p229|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY/p227/p227_253.wav|p227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY/p239/p239_036.wav|p239|That can cost him a fortune.
DUMMY/p236/p236_066.wav|p236|Both men were on one-year contracts.
DUMMY/p244/p244_369.wav|p244|However, it was well worth the wait.
DUMMY/p246/p246_205.wav|p246|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY/p248/p248_070.wav|p248|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
DUMMY/p237/p237_347.wav|p237|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p239/p239_327.wav|p239|They make a selective perception process.
DUMMY/p243/p243_047.wav|p243|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_443.wav|p231|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY/p246/p246_192.wav|p246|I do not own the vessel in question.
DUMMY/p228/p228_091.wav|p228|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
DUMMY/p228/p228_196.wav|p228|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY/p236/p236_484.wav|p236|That is the bottom line.
DUMMY/p243/p243_363.wav|p243|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
DUMMY/p236/p236_212.wav|p236|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY/p236/p236_325.wav|p236|The law will take its course.
DUMMY/p237/p237_295.wav|p237|I saw it at a ruck.
DUMMY/p244/p244_174.wav|p244|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY/p243/p243_378.wav|p243|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
DUMMY/p236/p236_495.wav|p236|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
DUMMY/p241/p241_278.wav|p241|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY/p229/p229_273.wav|p229|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY/p239/p239_391.wav|p239|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_374.wav|p229|It is not too late to get on board.
DUMMY/p248/p248_277.wav|p248|He looked very sharp.
DUMMY/p237/p237_069.wav|p237|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p231/p231_462.wav|p231|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY/p239/p239_235.wav|p239|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY/p227/p227_229.wav|p227|It's just a normal life.
DUMMY/p239/p239_349.wav|p239|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
DUMMY/p248/p248_354.wav|p248|It was that bad, that low.
DUMMY/p237/p237_225.wav|p237|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
DUMMY/p227/p227_328.wav|p227|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY/p231/p231_264.wav|p231|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_099.wav|p246|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY/p248/p248_310.wav|p248|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY/p232/p232_300.wav|p232|What has altered ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_364.wav|p227|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_116.wav|p225|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
DUMMY/p243/p243_076.wav|p243|It had little effect on European equity markets.
DUMMY/p228/p228_371.wav|p228|It became a national network.
DUMMY/p226/p226_272.wav|p226|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY/p231/p231_342.wav|p231|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p237/p237_327.wav|p237|The parents will have a great time, too.
DUMMY/p238/p238_249.wav|p238|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY/p241/p241_374.wav|p241|There is no signature.
DUMMY/p230/p230_219.wav|p230|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p247/p247_364.wav|p247|But we welcome this document.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_117.wav|p248|Maybe this battle has been.
DUMMY/p226/p226_042.wav|p226|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
DUMMY/p241/p241_222.wav|p241|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p239/p239_135.wav|p239|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
DUMMY/p239/p239_362.wav|p239|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY/p240/p240_079.wav|p240|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p239/p239_216.wav|p239|We had to add value.
DUMMY/p240/p240_040.wav|p240|It's a real threat.
DUMMY/p247/p247_301.wav|p247|We will deliver at director level.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_363.wav|p238|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
DUMMY/p232/p232_081.wav|p232|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p231/p231_336.wav|p231|I think it's about time.
DUMMY/p243/p243_249.wav|p243|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
DUMMY/p231/p231_388.wav|p231|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY/p226/p226_240.wav|p226|She is well balanced.
DUMMY/p231/p231_134.wav|p231|You're a gambling man.
DUMMY/p246/p246_249.wav|p246|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY/p240/p240_359.wav|p240|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY/p229/p229_292.wav|p229|We have other options.
DUMMY/p236/p236_016.wav|p236|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p244/p244_005.wav|p244|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p248/p248_125.wav|p248|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY/p232/p232_294.wav|p232|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY/p227/p227_311.wav|p227|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
DUMMY/p234/p234_159.wav|p234|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY/p239/p239_421.wav|p239|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY/p246/p246_329.wav|p246|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p225/p225_365.wav|p225|You did not see it.
DUMMY/p228/p228_220.wav|p228|I had decided to quit the show.
DUMMY/p234/p234_199.wav|p234|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY/p246/p246_001.wav|p246|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p243/p243_397.wav|p243|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p231/p231_104.wav|p231|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_077.wav|p239|He phoned the number in the brochure.
DUMMY/p234/p234_261.wav|p234|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p236/p236_199.wav|p236|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
DUMMY/p240/p240_246.wav|p240|It is hard won.
DUMMY/p236/p236_352.wav|p236|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY/p248/p248_106.wav|p248|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
DUMMY/p245/p245_165.wav|p245|What has caused the demise of singing?
DUMMY/p240/p240_211.wav|p240|We'll have to work hard today.
DUMMY/p228/p228_086.wav|p228|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY/p228/p228_348.wav|p228|Everyone was in tears.
DUMMY/p246/p246_142.wav|p246|I was awful.
DUMMY/p237/p237_206.wav|p237|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
DUMMY/p247/p247_121.wav|p247|That might help a bit.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_331.wav|p247|This is a moment to seize.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_353.wav|p228|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
DUMMY/p234/p234_124.wav|p234|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY/p249/p249_055.wav|p249|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY/p227/p227_283.wav|p227|Every one is a winner.
DUMMY/p228/p228_199.wav|p228|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
DUMMY/p236/p236_284.wav|p236|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY/p240/p240_127.wav|p240|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
DUMMY/p249/p249_033.wav|p249|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
DUMMY/p226/p226_336.wav|p226|It is a time bomb.
DUMMY/p249/p249_291.wav|p249|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY/p230/p230_234.wav|p230|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
DUMMY/p244/p244_142.wav|p244|That was the first step.
DUMMY/p231/p231_404.wav|p231|It is hard to understand.
DUMMY/p238/p238_407.wav|p238|And it had two seats.
DUMMY/p238/p238_288.wav|p238|Says the Duke of York.
DUMMY/p245/p245_128.wav|p245|I was awful.
DUMMY/p226/p226_341.wav|p226|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p227/p227_027.wav|p227|I feel I did not have enough time.
DUMMY/p246/p246_072.wav|p246|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p225/p225_351.wav|p225|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_332.wav|p231|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY/p234/p234_339.wav|p234|I think the overall picture is still strong.
DUMMY/p228/p228_160.wav|p228|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
DUMMY/p249/p249_251.wav|p249|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
DUMMY/p240/p240_357.wav|p240|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY/p246/p246_172.wav|p246|If that's the case, he will struggle.
DUMMY/p237/p237_232.wav|p237|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY/p244/p244_359.wav|p244|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY/p237/p237_284.wav|p237|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p228/p228_366.wav|p228|But I managed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_129.wav|p226|She has been shot.
DUMMY/p245/p245_348.wav|p245|They should take their mobile phones.
DUMMY/p246/p246_277.wav|p246|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY/p230/p230_318.wav|p230|They are not left wing.
DUMMY/p226/p226_040.wav|p226|It was clear.
DUMMY/p245/p245_226.wav|p245|It's quite a line-up!
DUMMY/p244/p244_418.wav|p244|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
DUMMY/p231/p231_092.wav|p231|Their attitude is all wrong.
DUMMY/p237/p237_150.wav|p237|Is that Titanic ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_289.wav|p228|The home was now under new management.
DUMMY/p225/p225_296.wav|p225|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY/p239/p239_251.wav|p239|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY/p237/p237_157.wav|p237|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY/p230/p230_365.wav|p230|Alex Ferguson is the same.
DUMMY/p225/p225_244.wav|p225|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_363.wav|p230|Nobody else was with me.
DUMMY/p228/p228_043.wav|p228|It is urgent.
DUMMY/p226/p226_162.wav|p226|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY/p231/p231_354.wav|p231|Neither man has been charged.
DUMMY/p229/p229_157.wav|p229|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p234/p234_189.wav|p234|It is simply not true.
DUMMY/p232/p232_410.wav|p232|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
DUMMY/p241/p241_199.wav|p241|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
DUMMY/p227/p227_348.wav|p227|In the old days, it was easy.
DUMMY/p234/p234_320.wav|p234|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
DUMMY/p231/p231_025.wav|p231|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
DUMMY/p244/p244_078.wav|p244|That will be the office.
DUMMY/p234/p234_242.wav|p234|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_047.wav|p234|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
DUMMY/p238/p238_278.wav|p238|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
DUMMY/p247/p247_006.wav|p247|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
DUMMY/p228/p228_211.wav|p228|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY/p247/p247_410.wav|p247|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_076.wav|p226|Help is needed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_353.wav|p239|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_279.wav|p247|It was a minor incident.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_269.wav|p241|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY/p247/p247_213.wav|p247|Harry Potter has lost his magic.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_099.wav|p228|It is annoying.
DUMMY/p247/p247_348.wav|p247|Had this been common practice ?)
DUMMY/p230/p230_088.wav|p230|You might not make it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_194.wav|p248|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY/p230/p230_133.wav|p230|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p231/p231_125.wav|p231|That period was a struggle.
DUMMY/p245/p245_340.wav|p245|There's no place to hide.
DUMMY/p246/p246_220.wav|p246|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY/p228/p228_351.wav|p228|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
DUMMY/p238/p238_150.wav|p238|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY/p232/p232_181.wav|p232|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY/p239/p239_460.wav|p239|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
DUMMY/p240/p240_300.wav|p240|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
DUMMY/p246/p246_021.wav|p246|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p249/p249_165.wav|p249|These days are long gone.
DUMMY/p230/p230_135.wav|p230|I would relish the prospect.
DUMMY/p226/p226_157.wav|p226|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
DUMMY/p248/p248_305.wav|p248|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
DUMMY/p237/p237_146.wav|p237|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
DUMMY/p236/p236_062.wav|p236|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY/p236/p236_282.wav|p236|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
DUMMY/p247/p247_205.wav|p247|The early physical reports were clear.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_272.wav|p249|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
DUMMY/p230/p230_265.wav|p230|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p247/p247_197.wav|p247|We represent a wide range of society.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_213.wav|p226|Feel the heat?
DUMMY/p241/p241_204.wav|p241|They've got three-quarters of the way.
DUMMY/p236/p236_339.wav|p236|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
DUMMY/p230/p230_405.wav|p230|It was a bank holiday, after all.
DUMMY/p248/p248_137.wav|p248|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY/p246/p246_086.wav|p246|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
DUMMY/p249/p249_061.wav|p249|Jobs could go.
DUMMY/p230/p230_289.wav|p230|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY/p227/p227_329.wav|p227|He would help me with the form.
DUMMY/p241/p241_236.wav|p241|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY/p227/p227_257.wav|p227|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY/p231/p231_078.wav|p231|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY/p245/p245_102.wav|p245|I have had no social life at all.
DUMMY/p226/p226_135.wav|p226|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p231/p231_159.wav|p231|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_069.wav|p230|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p237/p237_056.wav|p237|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
DUMMY/p243/p243_250.wav|p243|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
DUMMY/p247/p247_158.wav|p247|Anyone can do the sums.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_212.wav|p246|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY/p243/p243_168.wav|p243|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
DUMMY/p227/p227_373.wav|p227|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p239/p239_379.wav|p239|He did not say that.
DUMMY/p247/p247_229.wav|p247|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_055.wav|p245|He had no enemies.
DUMMY/p231/p231_106.wav|p231|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_115.wav|p246|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
DUMMY/p248/p248_054.wav|p248|They had to explain it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_144.wav|p236|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY/p246/p246_036.wav|p246|It has failed.
DUMMY/p227/p227_144.wav|p227|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p244/p244_330.wav|p244|And we can do it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_285.wav|p231|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
DUMMY/p232/p232_002.wav|p232|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p231/p231_148.wav|p231|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY/p225/p225_056.wav|p225|Clearly, it can go either way.
DUMMY/p238/p238_010.wav|p238|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p236/p236_290.wav|p236|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p236/p236_381.wav|p236|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
DUMMY/p245/p245_225.wav|p245|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY/p249/p249_336.wav|p249|The train was on time.
DUMMY/p230/p230_296.wav|p230|It took a month and a half to film.
DUMMY/p247/p247_374.wav|p247|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY/p228/p228_248.wav|p228|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p240/p240_279.wav|p240|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p227/p227_222.wav|p227|They have known the hard times.
DUMMY/p227/p227_178.wav|p227|I'm just going to hit the shot.
DUMMY/p239/p239_141.wav|p239|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
DUMMY/p232/p232_223.wav|p232|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p226/p226_280.wav|p226|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY/p234/p234_185.wav|p234|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY/p230/p230_321.wav|p230|It is a road of death.
DUMMY/p247/p247_013.wav|p247|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
DUMMY/p227/p227_126.wav|p227|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
DUMMY/p239/p239_179.wav|p239|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_416.wav|p238|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
DUMMY/p243/p243_085.wav|p243|No plan for projects are yet in place.
DUMMY/p229/p229_062.wav|p229|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p227/p227_342.wav|p227|Have a look at this lot.
DUMMY/p239/p239_014.wav|p239|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p228/p228_045.wav|p228|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY/p232/p232_273.wav|p232|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY/p243/p243_348.wav|p243|And that is the bottom line - box office.
DUMMY/p244/p244_221.wav|p244|It was important to win today.
DUMMY/p244/p244_089.wav|p244|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY/p238/p238_419.wav|p238|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY/p248/p248_063.wav|p248|It is not great art.
DUMMY/p249/p249_289.wav|p249|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY/p236/p236_331.wav|p236|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY/p237/p237_191.wav|p237|It's a joke.
DUMMY/p234/p234_046.wav|p234|The man became a reporter.
DUMMY/p230/p230_290.wav|p230|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY/p236/p236_408.wav|p236|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY/p243/p243_184.wav|p243|We have come a long way since then.
DUMMY/p225/p225_110.wav|p225|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p232/p232_253.wav|p232|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
DUMMY/p227/p227_056.wav|p227|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_053.wav|p234|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
DUMMY/p226/p226_104.wav|p226|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
DUMMY/p229/p229_064.wav|p229|We should have known.
DUMMY/p244/p244_141.wav|p244|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
DUMMY/p236/p236_137.wav|p236|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
DUMMY/p227/p227_181.wav|p227|I think it's a good sign.
DUMMY/p246/p246_290.wav|p246|He will address the nation this evening.
