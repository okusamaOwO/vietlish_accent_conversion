DUMMY/p250/p250_153.wav|p250|She died at her home.
DUMMY/p237/p237_010.wav|p237|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_012.wav|p227|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p228/p228_088.wav|p228|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
DUMMY/p241/p241_304.wav|p241|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY/p228/p228_302.wav|p228|Is there on his hands ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_205.wav|p246|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY/p229/p229_251.wav|p229|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p231/p231_050.wav|p231|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY/p245/p245_276.wav|p245|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p236/p236_274.wav|p236|He will go on the bench.
DUMMY/p246/p246_017.wav|p246|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p227/p227_022.wav|p227|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p231/p231_052.wav|p231|We have not given up hope.
DUMMY/p232/p232_138.wav|p232|What will happen then ?
DUMMY/p241/p241_088.wav|p241|And rugby fans can help.
DUMMY/p241/p241_011.wav|p241|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p239/p239_381.wav|p239|We have not been approached.
DUMMY/p229/p229_389.wav|p229|That's the name of the game, though.
DUMMY/p250/p250_233.wav|p250|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
DUMMY/p240/p240_282.wav|p240|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
DUMMY/p225/p225_222.wav|p225|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY/p229/p229_057.wav|p229|She's a spy !
DUMMY/p228/p228_310.wav|p228|There was some merit in that.
DUMMY/p236/p236_396.wav|p236|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_002.wav|p226|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p227/p227_077.wav|p227|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY/p230/p230_008.wav|p230|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p241/p241_159.wav|p241|I've put my own money into this project.
DUMMY/p239/p239_219.wav|p239|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY/p230/p230_367.wav|p230|But BA said the prediction was premature.
DUMMY/p239/p239_247.wav|p239|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY/p228/p228_047.wav|p228|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
DUMMY/p231/p231_186.wav|p231|They need to look after themselves.
DUMMY/p239/p239_448.wav|p239|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
DUMMY/p244/p244_002.wav|p244|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p229/p229_129.wav|p229|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p247/p247_067.wav|p247|It came as a surprise.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_111.wav|p225|It isn't a happy memory.
DUMMY/p236/p236_078.wav|p236|He was just a journalist.
DUMMY/p237/p237_185.wav|p237|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
DUMMY/p249/p249_121.wav|p249|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
DUMMY/p250/p250_079.wav|p250|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY/p240/p240_199.wav|p240|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY/p246/p246_234.wav|p246|You should be.
DUMMY/p247/p247_247.wav|p247|I am not going to go tomorrow.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_378.wav|p229|They play together perfectly.
DUMMY/p226/p226_098.wav|p226|If you could find it.
DUMMY/p250/p250_326.wav|p250|McNaughton was not so sure.
DUMMY/p247/p247_108.wav|p247|We made a world record together.)
DUMMY/p250/p250_491.wav|p250|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p232/p232_118.wav|p232|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p241/p241_152.wav|p241|They were later discharged from hospital.
DUMMY/p244/p244_029.wav|p244|It is about investing in the future.
DUMMY/p247/p247_268.wav|p247|Messages have to be reinforced.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_285.wav|p230|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_107.wav|p227|Then came the farewell to Europe.
DUMMY/p240/p240_085.wav|p240|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
DUMMY/p226/p226_107.wav|p226|It was a good performance.
DUMMY/p226/p226_026.wav|p226|That's no bad thing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_416.wav|p239|You're not getting any goodwill.
DUMMY/p248/p248_063.wav|p248|It is not great art.
DUMMY/p249/p249_062.wav|p249|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p236/p236_033.wav|p236|This is a central issue.
DUMMY/p248/p248_196.wav|p248|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
DUMMY/p229/p229_050.wav|p229|We need to chat.
DUMMY/p243/p243_302.wav|p243|And does it ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_358.wav|p243|His style was direct and very human.
DUMMY/p234/p234_015.wav|p234|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p245/p245_228.wav|p245|This fact is supported by audience research.
DUMMY/p238/p238_181.wav|p238|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
DUMMY/p244/p244_267.wav|p244|But we were in control at that point.
DUMMY/p239/p239_234.wav|p239|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY/p229/p229_006.wav|p229|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_351.wav|p238|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_243.wav|p247|They have to be able to play the game.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_417.wav|p238|This would discourage investment and job creation.
DUMMY/p239/p239_026.wav|p239|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
DUMMY/p231/p231_180.wav|p231|I have spoken to head office.
DUMMY/p230/p230_165.wav|p230|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p237/p237_140.wav|p237|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY/p236/p236_492.wav|p236|The BBC was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p244/p244_119.wav|p244|The procedures were not in place.
DUMMY/p230/p230_250.wav|p230|We have to compete at our own level.
DUMMY/p228/p228_016.wav|p228|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p236/p236_142.wav|p236|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY/p227/p227_386.wav|p227|I do not like to lose.
DUMMY/p238/p238_141.wav|p238|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
DUMMY/p239/p239_332.wav|p239|January is a bad time of year.
DUMMY/p228/p228_108.wav|p228|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
DUMMY/p249/p249_351.wav|p249|It was very formal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_322.wav|p244|We did something about it.
DUMMY/p229/p229_270.wav|p229|They are never here.
DUMMY/p230/p230_169.wav|p230|On the month the weakness was across the board.
DUMMY/p236/p236_344.wav|p236|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
DUMMY/p245/p245_058.wav|p245|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p238/p238_333.wav|p238|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY/p232/p232_022.wav|p232|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p236/p236_219.wav|p236|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY/p231/p231_308.wav|p231|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
DUMMY/p246/p246_002.wav|p246|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p245/p245_118.wav|p245|He has been under great pressure.
DUMMY/p227/p227_073.wav|p227|It is a terrible place.
DUMMY/p232/p232_078.wav|p232|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p231/p231_157.wav|p231|He was right into football from an early age.
DUMMY/p227/p227_126.wav|p227|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
DUMMY/p227/p227_367.wav|p227|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_044.wav|p248|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY/p231/p231_253.wav|p231|It was a cry for help.
DUMMY/p228/p228_182.wav|p228|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
DUMMY/p244/p244_064.wav|p244|We felt it was sufficient.
DUMMY/p250/p250_243.wav|p250|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p247/p247_420.wav|p247|That is not the position of the British relatives.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_105.wav|p245|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
DUMMY/p247/p247_133.wav|p247|The answer was in space.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_251.wav|p247|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_077.wav|p245|That is bound to happen.
DUMMY/p231/p231_267.wav|p231|Did he trip ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_191.wav|p240|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY/p241/p241_187.wav|p241|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY/p243/p243_102.wav|p243|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
DUMMY/p231/p231_140.wav|p231|I think he's the favourite, no question.
DUMMY/p227/p227_159.wav|p227|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY/p238/p238_040.wav|p238|I remember that day well.
DUMMY/p244/p244_244.wav|p244|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p243/p243_147.wav|p243|You should feel involved in their lives.
DUMMY/p246/p246_295.wav|p246|Bombing slaughter rejected
DUMMY/p243/p243_186.wav|p243|A great player has to win major championships.
DUMMY/p234/p234_072.wav|p234|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
DUMMY/p237/p237_047.wav|p237|It is urgent.
DUMMY/p225/p225_090.wav|p225|I did not have a bet on myself.
DUMMY/p247/p247_022.wav|p247|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
DUMMY/p228/p228_283.wav|p228|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p244/p244_416.wav|p244|There is no need to panic.
DUMMY/p246/p246_313.wav|p246|We have got no money to go anywhere.
DUMMY/p249/p249_291.wav|p249|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY/p243/p243_225.wav|p243|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
DUMMY/p230/p230_417.wav|p230|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
DUMMY/p246/p246_326.wav|p246|He scored a touchdown.
DUMMY/p232/p232_265.wav|p232|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY/p244/p244_023.wav|p244|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p227/p227_083.wav|p227|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p226/p226_306.wav|p226|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
DUMMY/p234/p234_076.wav|p234|We can all make a mistake.
DUMMY/p239/p239_181.wav|p239|Did it work ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_146.wav|p227|Like the others, he was arrested.
DUMMY/p249/p249_344.wav|p249|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY/p226/p226_359.wav|p226|He's very explosive.
DUMMY/p246/p246_351.wav|p246|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p239/p239_174.wav|p239|As if that is an achievement.
DUMMY/p236/p236_175.wav|p236|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_290.wav|p247|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.)
DUMMY/p240/p240_121.wav|p240|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p232/p232_199.wav|p232|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY/p236/p236_138.wav|p236|It was a piece of art.
DUMMY/p249/p249_290.wav|p249|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
DUMMY/p244/p244_185.wav|p244|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
DUMMY/p246/p246_113.wav|p246|Who would be a referee?
DUMMY/p244/p244_157.wav|p244|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
DUMMY/p246/p246_149.wav|p246|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
DUMMY/p231/p231_401.wav|p231|She is in their hands.
DUMMY/p239/p239_071.wav|p239|Then they scored two goals to win.
DUMMY/p248/p248_163.wav|p248|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
DUMMY/p225/p225_337.wav|p225|But they have the sound.
DUMMY/p236/p236_046.wav|p236|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p241/p241_042.wav|p241|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
DUMMY/p232/p232_308.wav|p232|We are in the end game.
DUMMY/p226/p226_145.wav|p226|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
DUMMY/p231/p231_080.wav|p231|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
DUMMY/p245/p245_287.wav|p245|That could change.
DUMMY/p226/p226_231.wav|p226|The track is currently covered in snow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_042.wav|p249|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY/p228/p228_143.wav|p228|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY/p238/p238_274.wav|p238|He is a right bastard.
DUMMY/p247/p247_406.wav|p247|But the foundations have been laid.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_136.wav|p245|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
DUMMY/p241/p241_350.wav|p241|There is a cup final at stake.
DUMMY/p227/p227_088.wav|p227|We will deal with the refugees.
DUMMY/p226/p226_091.wav|p226|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p231/p231_370.wav|p231|This is a major championship.
DUMMY/p230/p230_368.wav|p230|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p236/p236_346.wav|p236|It's a policy which has worked for us.
DUMMY/p231/p231_237.wav|p231|Hospitals are for the ill.
DUMMY/p227/p227_173.wav|p227|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY/p247/p247_181.wav|p247|I always felt they played for me.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_003.wav|p238|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p237/p237_002.wav|p237|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p232/p232_282.wav|p232|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
DUMMY/p238/p238_432.wav|p238|It was like the old days.
DUMMY/p239/p239_008.wav|p239|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p248/p248_011.wav|p248|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p231/p231_249.wav|p231|This ruling is a farce.
DUMMY/p232/p232_061.wav|p232|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
DUMMY/p230/p230_025.wav|p230|It is on the internet.
DUMMY/p248/p248_177.wav|p248|And I saw the light!
DUMMY/p245/p245_032.wav|p245|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p248/p248_276.wav|p248|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY/p249/p249_332.wav|p249|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p244/p244_390.wav|p244|He was on a mission.
DUMMY/p226/p226_230.wav|p226|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
DUMMY/p239/p239_476.wav|p239|Banking stocks were hit hard.
DUMMY/p238/p238_431.wav|p238|We go there with confidence.
DUMMY/p225/p225_203.wav|p225|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY/p237/p237_089.wav|p237|Now the system is right behind us.
DUMMY/p226/p226_139.wav|p226|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_075.wav|p243|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
DUMMY/p232/p232_080.wav|p232|I've got the shirt.
DUMMY/p240/p240_311.wav|p240|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
DUMMY/p238/p238_422.wav|p238|The company declined to comment.
DUMMY/p241/p241_371.wav|p241|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY/p246/p246_328.wav|p246|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
DUMMY/p236/p236_124.wav|p236|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY/p245/p245_271.wav|p245|She looked so young.
DUMMY/p229/p229_027.wav|p229|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY/p239/p239_065.wav|p239|They desperately want some stability.
DUMMY/p232/p232_357.wav|p232|He had played well in that central role.
DUMMY/p241/p241_205.wav|p241|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
DUMMY/p250/p250_287.wav|p250|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_388.wav|p231|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
DUMMY/p236/p236_475.wav|p236|I could feel the blood on my face.
DUMMY/p247/p247_329.wav|p247|Investors can be forgiven for caution.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_135.wav|p234|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_325.wav|p226|I am very happy to be here.
DUMMY/p236/p236_059.wav|p236|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY/p246/p246_358.wav|p246|Their time has gone.
DUMMY/p244/p244_211.wav|p244|He is believed to live in Britain.
DUMMY/p229/p229_342.wav|p229|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p241/p241_267.wav|p241|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
DUMMY/p244/p244_299.wav|p244|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_268.wav|p236|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
DUMMY/p231/p231_394.wav|p231|That's as good as it gets.
DUMMY/p250/p250_164.wav|p250|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p249/p249_053.wav|p249|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
DUMMY/p229/p229_222.wav|p229|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY/p239/p239_497.wav|p239|They haven't been thought through.
DUMMY/p239/p239_376.wav|p239|It was launched in February last year.
DUMMY/p236/p236_045.wav|p236|We are working on it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_058.wav|p225|However, the problem is the timing.
DUMMY/p240/p240_270.wav|p240|It looks as though he will be right.
DUMMY/p227/p227_326.wav|p227|The dealer is on notice.
DUMMY/p240/p240_177.wav|p240|There is no point in looking any further.
DUMMY/p231/p231_098.wav|p231|We live by the rule of law.
DUMMY/p239/p239_233.wav|p239|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY/p239/p239_028.wav|p239|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
DUMMY/p244/p244_224.wav|p244|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY/p234/p234_086.wav|p234|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_186.wav|p230|He prefers to play for them.
DUMMY/p241/p241_274.wav|p241|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY/p248/p248_179.wav|p248|Tony had arrived.
DUMMY/p231/p231_379.wav|p231|The pair are very much in love.
DUMMY/p231/p231_457.wav|p231|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
DUMMY/p249/p249_113.wav|p249|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p246/p246_141.wav|p246|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
DUMMY/p239/p239_118.wav|p239|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
DUMMY/p245/p245_178.wav|p245|It was still there, but right at the end.
DUMMY/p245/p245_294.wav|p245|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p247/p247_286.wav|p247|It is also very valuable.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_030.wav|p243|She brought a lot to my life.
DUMMY/p247/p247_220.wav|p247|Did he trip ?)
DUMMY/p234/p234_179.wav|p234|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY/p245/p245_290.wav|p245|This is a huge confidence boost.
DUMMY/p237/p237_074.wav|p237|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY/p245/p245_005.wav|p245|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p227/p227_200.wav|p227|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY/p244/p244_173.wav|p244|We were all over the place in the first half.
DUMMY/p228/p228_071.wav|p228|The script was funny.
DUMMY/p241/p241_211.wav|p241|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY/p248/p248_340.wav|p248|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
DUMMY/p246/p246_119.wav|p246|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p245/p245_299.wav|p245|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
DUMMY/p238/p238_111.wav|p238|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
DUMMY/p241/p241_007.wav|p241|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p234/p234_132.wav|p234|The problem was a social problem.
DUMMY/p229/p229_200.wav|p229|I've got good news and bad news for you.
DUMMY/p239/p239_180.wav|p239|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_295.wav|p240|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
DUMMY/p238/p238_184.wav|p238|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
DUMMY/p249/p249_247.wav|p249|There wasn't a goal.
DUMMY/p236/p236_302.wav|p236|It's all designed to speed up the service.
DUMMY/p238/p238_238.wav|p238|Five years later, the deception continued.
DUMMY/p230/p230_288.wav|p230|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
DUMMY/p238/p238_253.wav|p238|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_344.wav|p227|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY/p244/p244_045.wav|p244|They are going after them.
DUMMY/p231/p231_444.wav|p231|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
DUMMY/p250/p250_385.wav|p250|We will win the argument.
DUMMY/p243/p243_189.wav|p243|The story was not made public by this club.
DUMMY/p250/p250_218.wav|p250|It carried a double message.
DUMMY/p238/p238_158.wav|p238|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
DUMMY/p248/p248_363.wav|p248|They have not done so this season so far.
DUMMY/p245/p245_320.wav|p245|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p228/p228_280.wav|p228|We want to see the maximum of change.
DUMMY/p239/p239_121.wav|p239|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY/p244/p244_160.wav|p244|We want to get there.
DUMMY/p249/p249_077.wav|p249|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
DUMMY/p247/p247_129.wav|p247|In addition, investor choice is reduced.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_015.wav|p246|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p231/p231_329.wav|p231|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY/p232/p232_405.wav|p232|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
DUMMY/p238/p238_043.wav|p238|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY/p241/p241_069.wav|p241|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
DUMMY/p246/p246_160.wav|p246|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
DUMMY/p239/p239_298.wav|p239|We may need to take some very radical measures.
DUMMY/p229/p229_005.wav|p229|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p247/p247_116.wav|p247|We deserve a significant rise.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_374.wav|p244|However, it does not seem to be the case.
DUMMY/p228/p228_045.wav|p228|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY/p245/p245_308.wav|p245|This is the culture change in medicine.
DUMMY/p246/p246_082.wav|p246|It is a blow.
DUMMY/p247/p247_212.wav|p247|His injury was completely random.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_284.wav|p241|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY/p232/p232_072.wav|p232|That was the easy election.
DUMMY/p227/p227_197.wav|p227|The force is with them.
DUMMY/p230/p230_324.wav|p230|We were on our way.
DUMMY/p245/p245_031.wav|p245|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
DUMMY/p244/p244_215.wav|p244|A team is a team.
DUMMY/p240/p240_015.wav|p240|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p228/p228_192.wav|p228|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
DUMMY/p243/p243_116.wav|p243|Had this been common practice ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_218.wav|p239|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
DUMMY/p244/p244_392.wav|p244|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_262.wav|p230|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY/p238/p238_175.wav|p238|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
DUMMY/p238/p238_364.wav|p238|William Hague delighted his party.
DUMMY/p250/p250_465.wav|p250|Let that be their memorial.
DUMMY/p227/p227_244.wav|p227|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p239/p239_397.wav|p239|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
DUMMY/p244/p244_373.wav|p244|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p243/p243_265.wav|p243|His condition was described as serious last night.
DUMMY/p225/p225_173.wav|p225|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
DUMMY/p225/p225_072.wav|p225|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p244/p244_121.wav|p244|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY/p230/p230_105.wav|p230|It is close to call.
DUMMY/p247/p247_410.wav|p247|The casualties were not named.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_318.wav|p227|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p232/p232_098.wav|p232|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
DUMMY/p249/p249_067.wav|p249|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p229/p229_142.wav|p229|What will happen then ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_213.wav|p234|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
DUMMY/p250/p250_427.wav|p250|I am astonished at attack.
DUMMY/p237/p237_011.wav|p237|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p250/p250_155.wav|p250|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_161.wav|p237|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p240/p240_109.wav|p240|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY/p234/p234_165.wav|p234|Anyone can do the sums.
DUMMY/p240/p240_164.wav|p240|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
DUMMY/p244/p244_207.wav|p244|He played it like a veteran.
DUMMY/p228/p228_100.wav|p228|We could not get any possession.
DUMMY/p226/p226_154.wav|p226|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
DUMMY/p231/p231_105.wav|p231|So, did she meet him ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_186.wav|p250|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
DUMMY/p238/p238_349.wav|p238|My father died in childbirth.
DUMMY/p230/p230_335.wav|p230|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_407.wav|p236|He seems to be used to the attention.
DUMMY/p232/p232_349.wav|p232|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
DUMMY/p231/p231_456.wav|p231|They have to be met.
DUMMY/p229/p229_238.wav|p229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
DUMMY/p239/p239_271.wav|p239|Each case is treated on merit.
DUMMY/p225/p225_153.wav|p225|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p226/p226_012.wav|p226|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p250/p250_252.wav|p250|The most important thing is the game.
DUMMY/p227/p227_328.wav|p227|The party lasted all night.
DUMMY/p229/p229_202.wav|p229|People will ask about us.
DUMMY/p238/p238_197.wav|p238|His words were not audible.
DUMMY/p231/p231_041.wav|p231|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
DUMMY/p238/p238_361.wav|p238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p227/p227_397.wav|p227|They have not got anyone.
DUMMY/p240/p240_348.wav|p240|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
DUMMY/p244/p244_348.wav|p244|We never played at all.
DUMMY/p234/p234_016.wav|p234|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY/p244/p244_287.wav|p244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p239/p239_367.wav|p239|But the rally was short-lived.
DUMMY/p238/p238_292.wav|p238|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
DUMMY/p228/p228_095.wav|p228|Safety was also an issue.
DUMMY/p241/p241_002.wav|p241|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p229/p229_135.wav|p229|It's an amazing landscape !
DUMMY/p248/p248_074.wav|p248|I had my suspicions.
DUMMY/p248/p248_264.wav|p248|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
DUMMY/p238/p238_410.wav|p238|But nothing could be done.
DUMMY/p244/p244_261.wav|p244|But it was a loss.
DUMMY/p236/p236_225.wav|p236|There is no quick fix.
DUMMY/p227/p227_313.wav|p227|It could well be military.
DUMMY/p240/p240_204.wav|p240|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
DUMMY/p239/p239_470.wav|p239|This does not create any precedent.
DUMMY/p229/p229_373.wav|p229|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY/p231/p231_145.wav|p231|It opens the door to the Champions League.
DUMMY/p244/p244_183.wav|p244|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
DUMMY/p232/p232_310.wav|p232|He was solid.
DUMMY/p230/p230_254.wav|p230|She took them for a term.
DUMMY/p228/p228_043.wav|p228|It is urgent.
DUMMY/p225/p225_308.wav|p225|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p225/p225_196.wav|p225|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_175.wav|p240|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
DUMMY/p228/p228_188.wav|p228|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
DUMMY/p238/p238_167.wav|p238|We can't get over it.
DUMMY/p230/p230_178.wav|p230|Tomorrow is a new day.
DUMMY/p236/p236_064.wav|p236|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p239/p239_460.wav|p239|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
DUMMY/p229/p229_051.wav|p229|It is difficult for Ali.
DUMMY/p237/p237_038.wav|p237|It is not for any other purpose.
DUMMY/p229/p229_035.wav|p229|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p243/p243_286.wav|p243|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
DUMMY/p230/p230_388.wav|p230|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
DUMMY/p229/p229_322.wav|p229|It should be equal.
DUMMY/p238/p238_298.wav|p238|They will probably come back.
DUMMY/p246/p246_093.wav|p246|It is home-grown.
DUMMY/p247/p247_366.wav|p247|He can handle it without any problem.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_223.wav|p247|His third goal was superb.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_355.wav|p246|It is a memorial.
DUMMY/p232/p232_129.wav|p232|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
DUMMY/p239/p239_245.wav|p239|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p225/p225_052.wav|p225|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
DUMMY/p234/p234_177.wav|p234|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY/p228/p228_158.wav|p228|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY/p226/p226_180.wav|p226|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p226/p226_198.wav|p226|Is that it?
DUMMY/p245/p245_127.wav|p245|There is a lack of chemistry.
DUMMY/p228/p228_208.wav|p228|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
DUMMY/p229/p229_229.wav|p229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
DUMMY/p227/p227_054.wav|p227|I could not do it.
DUMMY/p230/p230_230.wav|p230|That has been the easy part.
DUMMY/p234/p234_181.wav|p234|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY/p249/p249_243.wav|p249|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
DUMMY/p243/p243_266.wav|p243|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
DUMMY/p249/p249_007.wav|p249|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p249/p249_043.wav|p249|The boy is no longer with us.
DUMMY/p227/p227_304.wav|p227|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p237/p237_231.wav|p237|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
DUMMY/p247/p247_047.wav|p247|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_175.wav|p246|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
DUMMY/p225/p225_365.wav|p225|You did not see it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_315.wav|p239|What are you not good at ?
DUMMY/p236/p236_289.wav|p236|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
DUMMY/p244/p244_093.wav|p244|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
DUMMY/p241/p241_283.wav|p241|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p237/p237_252.wav|p237|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
DUMMY/p244/p244_365.wav|p244|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY/p226/p226_254.wav|p226|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY/p236/p236_314.wav|p236|The answer is with ourselves.
DUMMY/p230/p230_241.wav|p230|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY/p234/p234_164.wav|p234|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p247/p247_342.wav|p247|It is inherent in society.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_111.wav|p245|I can't even get into the A team.
DUMMY/p241/p241_122.wav|p241|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
DUMMY/p229/p229_203.wav|p229|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p228/p228_297.wav|p228|You are the glory.
DUMMY/p249/p249_010.wav|p249|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p238/p238_177.wav|p238|The changes took effect from June.
DUMMY/p246/p246_133.wav|p246|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY/p232/p232_030.wav|p232|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
DUMMY/p240/p240_102.wav|p240|He takes the job.
DUMMY/p234/p234_202.wav|p234|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_374.wav|p239|That remains the unanswered question.
DUMMY/p245/p245_225.wav|p245|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
DUMMY/p248/p248_215.wav|p248|In each case they were a goal down.
DUMMY/p227/p227_398.wav|p227|I can hardly believe it.
DUMMY/p237/p237_232.wav|p237|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY/p236/p236_299.wav|p236|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_065.wav|p229|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p246/p246_073.wav|p246|People must remain vigilant.
DUMMY/p250/p250_306.wav|p250|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
DUMMY/p250/p250_353.wav|p250|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
DUMMY/p247/p247_465.wav|p247|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_359.wav|p230|Three years ago he would have been.
DUMMY/p244/p244_041.wav|p244|In London today, it was business as usual.
DUMMY/p239/p239_361.wav|p239|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p236/p236_395.wav|p236|I should think so, too.
DUMMY/p247/p247_214.wav|p247|I had relied on him.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_133.wav|p229|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY/p248/p248_245.wav|p248|It is hard won.
DUMMY/p244/p244_309.wav|p244|But it is a similar problem.
DUMMY/p226/p226_010.wav|p226|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY/p239/p239_437.wav|p239|Things are going to change over the next six months.
DUMMY/p239/p239_297.wav|p239|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_031.wav|p228|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY/p247/p247_333.wav|p247|The people will not be patient.)
DUMMY/p250/p250_480.wav|p250|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY/p247/p247_076.wav|p247|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_327.wav|p238|Little is known about them.
DUMMY/p247/p247_365.wav|p247|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_281.wav|p244|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
DUMMY/p250/p250_434.wav|p250|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
DUMMY/p227/p227_108.wav|p227|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY/p227/p227_373.wav|p227|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p234/p234_236.wav|p234|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY/p243/p243_232.wav|p243|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
DUMMY/p249/p249_293.wav|p249|Sunday's game was not a trial.
DUMMY/p250/p250_360.wav|p250|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p234/p234_040.wav|p234|We are the party of the future.
DUMMY/p241/p241_188.wav|p241|I wish I could say something.
DUMMY/p247/p247_084.wav|p247|The party is up for it.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_349.wav|p230|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
DUMMY/p240/p240_179.wav|p240|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
DUMMY/p230/p230_035.wav|p230|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
DUMMY/p234/p234_138.wav|p234|And does it ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_225.wav|p226|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p240/p240_058.wav|p240|However the drama was still not at an end.
DUMMY/p245/p245_282.wav|p245|It goes back a long way.
DUMMY/p247/p247_361.wav|p247|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_151.wav|p243|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_072.wav|p230|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_338.wav|p248|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
DUMMY/p241/p241_035.wav|p241|He took me on a tour of the wards.
DUMMY/p249/p249_048.wav|p249|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
DUMMY/p231/p231_428.wav|p231|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
DUMMY/p228/p228_015.wav|p228|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p236/p236_374.wav|p236|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
DUMMY/p227/p227_312.wav|p227|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
DUMMY/p244/p244_166.wav|p244|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
DUMMY/p247/p247_404.wav|p247|The BBC was a disgrace.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_042.wav|p244|And they had a case.
DUMMY/p243/p243_118.wav|p243|The idea is the shop within a shop.
DUMMY/p230/p230_127.wav|p230|The opposite is the case.
DUMMY/p232/p232_031.wav|p232|It's a matter of balance.
DUMMY/p225/p225_133.wav|p225|I think he's the favourite.
DUMMY/p226/p226_048.wav|p226|It's a blessing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_383.wav|p239|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
DUMMY/p230/p230_139.wav|p230|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
DUMMY/p226/p226_072.wav|p226|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p243/p243_362.wav|p243|He's young enough and he must learn.
DUMMY/p245/p245_311.wav|p245|I never thought it would take this long.
DUMMY/p231/p231_035.wav|p231|I became a widow overnight.
DUMMY/p240/p240_275.wav|p240|And Michael was just great.
DUMMY/p245/p245_151.wav|p245|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY/p232/p232_005.wav|p232|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p232/p232_277.wav|p232|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
DUMMY/p231/p231_268.wav|p231|I've had the time of my life.
DUMMY/p247/p247_377.wav|p247|Two things were clear from the new programme.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_051.wav|p225|We are committed to the ban.
DUMMY/p246/p246_309.wav|p246|The minister is the engineer.
DUMMY/p234/p234_008.wav|p234|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p229/p229_158.wav|p229|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p243/p243_185.wav|p243|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
DUMMY/p231/p231_154.wav|p231|A new school will be built.
DUMMY/p234/p234_353.wav|p234|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY/p246/p246_153.wav|p246|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
DUMMY/p245/p245_199.wav|p245|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
DUMMY/p228/p228_129.wav|p228|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p245/p245_040.wav|p245|It's a great thing.
DUMMY/p249/p249_078.wav|p249|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY/p246/p246_245.wav|p246|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p230/p230_298.wav|p230|It is a symbolic concert.
DUMMY/p246/p246_204.wav|p246|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
DUMMY/p232/p232_088.wav|p232|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
DUMMY/p228/p228_307.wav|p228|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY/p250/p250_032.wav|p250|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p250/p250_292.wav|p250|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
DUMMY/p228/p228_194.wav|p228|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
DUMMY/p250/p250_235.wav|p250|The process will start tomorrow.
DUMMY/p227/p227_102.wav|p227|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
DUMMY/p227/p227_370.wav|p227|We need to be prepared.
DUMMY/p227/p227_310.wav|p227|We are not increasing the number.
DUMMY/p226/p226_262.wav|p226|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
DUMMY/p231/p231_150.wav|p231|We have a clean bill of health.
DUMMY/p238/p238_407.wav|p238|And it had two seats.
DUMMY/p249/p249_241.wav|p249|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
DUMMY/p249/p249_012.wav|p249|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p230/p230_175.wav|p230|City sentiment is in his favour.
DUMMY/p245/p245_038.wav|p245|It has failed.
DUMMY/p232/p232_156.wav|p232|It is an attitude of mind.
DUMMY/p237/p237_341.wav|p237|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
DUMMY/p226/p226_049.wav|p226|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p250/p250_476.wav|p250|I have always believed in myself.
DUMMY/p238/p238_027.wav|p238|We must convince the citizens.
DUMMY/p232/p232_172.wav|p232|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY/p239/p239_379.wav|p239|He did not say that.
DUMMY/p238/p238_395.wav|p238|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
DUMMY/p243/p243_238.wav|p243|The children were later able to leave by bus.
DUMMY/p230/p230_387.wav|p230|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY/p232/p232_194.wav|p232|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
DUMMY/p247/p247_381.wav|p247|The major championships will always have a special place.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_121.wav|p248|She's got to say something.
DUMMY/p246/p246_348.wav|p246|Until they came to do it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_104.wav|p244|The trick is to try it.
DUMMY/p249/p249_090.wav|p249|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
DUMMY/p248/p248_127.wav|p248|So the European elections are extremely important.
DUMMY/p240/p240_328.wav|p240|They had a confession.
DUMMY/p231/p231_104.wav|p231|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_354.wav|p230|You have no chance of planning permission.
DUMMY/p237/p237_165.wav|p237|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY/p241/p241_036.wav|p241|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
DUMMY/p239/p239_441.wav|p239|The stage was set for a showdown.
DUMMY/p250/p250_495.wav|p250|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
DUMMY/p243/p243_256.wav|p243|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
DUMMY/p250/p250_082.wav|p250|I've had it for the exams.
DUMMY/p250/p250_423.wav|p250|Russell is delighted with them.
DUMMY/p238/p238_208.wav|p238|The refund is fully justified.
DUMMY/p230/p230_263.wav|p230|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
DUMMY/p236/p236_121.wav|p236|He is a lovely man.
DUMMY/p248/p248_304.wav|p248|We have waited a long time for this.
DUMMY/p239/p239_103.wav|p239|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
DUMMY/p228/p228_044.wav|p228|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
DUMMY/p228/p228_209.wav|p228|Who will pay for this ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_200.wav|p248|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY/p238/p238_169.wav|p238|I can see it now.
DUMMY/p236/p236_052.wav|p236|That was the difference today.
DUMMY/p228/p228_284.wav|p228|It changed my life.
DUMMY/p229/p229_155.wav|p229|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
DUMMY/p227/p227_369.wav|p227|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p247/p247_258.wav|p247|Labour was too busy to respond.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_352.wav|p226|His contract was then not renewed.
DUMMY/p226/p226_133.wav|p226|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY/p232/p232_195.wav|p232|I wanted to put myself on the line.
DUMMY/p243/p243_385.wav|p243|Why do it otherwise ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_323.wav|p248|Who will do it?
DUMMY/p238/p238_316.wav|p238|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY/p241/p241_017.wav|p241|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY/p231/p231_190.wav|p231|I'm interested in interesting work.
DUMMY/p236/p236_337.wav|p236|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
DUMMY/p227/p227_259.wav|p227|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
DUMMY/p237/p237_073.wav|p237|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
DUMMY/p250/p250_015.wav|p250|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p232/p232_170.wav|p232|We've made a couple of albums.
DUMMY/p243/p243_383.wav|p243|I just felt that I was broken down.
DUMMY/p228/p228_125.wav|p228|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p237/p237_191.wav|p237|It's a joke.
DUMMY/p241/p241_178.wav|p241|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p249/p249_136.wav|p249|What will happen then?
DUMMY/p228/p228_068.wav|p228|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_113.wav|p239|We have thought about doing lots of things.
DUMMY/p227/p227_210.wav|p227|This is a holy place.
DUMMY/p231/p231_371.wav|p231|The result is called a patent.
DUMMY/p247/p247_374.wav|p247|I got a yellow card.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_234.wav|p244|It will be decided in the next month.
DUMMY/p231/p231_312.wav|p231|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p248/p248_360.wav|p248|He could face a jail sentence.
DUMMY/p226/p226_174.wav|p226|It's quite a routine.
DUMMY/p234/p234_102.wav|p234|It is much as it has been described.
DUMMY/p247/p247_360.wav|p247|It's wonderful to have won.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_012.wav|p229|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p225/p225_013.wav|p225|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p239/p239_363.wav|p239|The actual increases will be announced next month.
DUMMY/p245/p245_096.wav|p245|No date has been set for the appeal.
DUMMY/p241/p241_115.wav|p241|He will emerge as a world leader.
DUMMY/p244/p244_001.wav|p244|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p227/p227_037.wav|p227|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p239/p239_317.wav|p239|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_114.wav|p239|It is sometimes like that.
DUMMY/p245/p245_043.wav|p245|She is believed to be in South Africa.
DUMMY/p238/p238_305.wav|p238|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
DUMMY/p228/p228_062.wav|p228|They're appalled by that.
DUMMY/p239/p239_456.wav|p239|Now it has doubled in size.
DUMMY/p248/p248_347.wav|p248|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p227/p227_214.wav|p227|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_372.wav|p248|Colour was at the core of his life.
DUMMY/p241/p241_269.wav|p241|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
DUMMY/p234/p234_243.wav|p234|Was everything done to save people ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_116.wav|p240|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
DUMMY/p231/p231_257.wav|p231|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_124.wav|p241|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY/p244/p244_201.wav|p244|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
DUMMY/p231/p231_048.wav|p231|There was no safety net.
DUMMY/p246/p246_108.wav|p246|I had some time with Aston Villa.
DUMMY/p234/p234_163.wav|p234|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY/p231/p231_002.wav|p231|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY/p232/p232_350.wav|p232|Chambers said he would accept the place.
DUMMY/p234/p234_007.wav|p234|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p241/p241_028.wav|p241|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
DUMMY/p234/p234_272.wav|p234|We want this place to work.
DUMMY/p248/p248_302.wav|p248|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
DUMMY/p243/p243_218.wav|p243|A European final must be the millennium target.
DUMMY/p250/p250_386.wav|p250|Is it worth it ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_009.wav|p227|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p228/p228_183.wav|p228|The hotel was now for sale.
DUMMY/p228/p228_228.wav|p228|It is a gamble.
DUMMY/p234/p234_091.wav|p234|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
DUMMY/p245/p245_060.wav|p245|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
DUMMY/p240/p240_186.wav|p240|They really did a great job.
DUMMY/p247/p247_196.wav|p247|I'm interested in interesting work.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_103.wav|p245|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
DUMMY/p239/p239_288.wav|p239|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
DUMMY/p250/p250_033.wav|p250|He works at the airport.
DUMMY/p231/p231_374.wav|p231|There is no deal as yet.
DUMMY/p239/p239_469.wav|p239|The partnership was set up during the summer.
DUMMY/p246/p246_047.wav|p246|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY/p234/p234_251.wav|p234|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p229/p229_074.wav|p229|It is a job creation scheme.
DUMMY/p232/p232_397.wav|p232|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
DUMMY/p247/p247_079.wav|p247|Both men were on one-year contracts.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_225.wav|p229|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY/p227/p227_265.wav|p227|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_256.wav|p228|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
DUMMY/p238/p238_068.wav|p238|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
DUMMY/p230/p230_375.wav|p230|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
DUMMY/p240/p240_158.wav|p240|Was this element always there?
DUMMY/p228/p228_265.wav|p228|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p250/p250_092.wav|p250|That view is held by many others within the industry.
DUMMY/p246/p246_148.wav|p246|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
DUMMY/p237/p237_339.wav|p237|They haven't got a hope.
DUMMY/p245/p245_346.wav|p245|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY/p240/p240_340.wav|p240|I've not thought about it.
DUMMY/p225/p225_030.wav|p225|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY/p226/p226_318.wav|p226|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p241/p241_024.wav|p241|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY/p243/p243_259.wav|p243|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
DUMMY/p247/p247_350.wav|p247|Is it worth it ?)
DUMMY/p246/p246_178.wav|p246|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
DUMMY/p231/p231_349.wav|p231|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_321.wav|p238|We believe a third party was involved.
DUMMY/p241/p241_134.wav|p241|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
DUMMY/p241/p241_023.wav|p241|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p238/p238_220.wav|p238|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY/p246/p246_111.wav|p246|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
DUMMY/p246/p246_100.wav|p246|That would be unlawful.
DUMMY/p244/p244_239.wav|p244|There was a lot of resentment.
DUMMY/p248/p248_173.wav|p248|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
DUMMY/p229/p229_161.wav|p229|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY/p230/p230_338.wav|p230|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
DUMMY/p248/p248_238.wav|p248|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
DUMMY/p236/p236_361.wav|p236|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
DUMMY/p238/p238_157.wav|p238|The following are the principal provisions.
DUMMY/p240/p240_325.wav|p240|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
DUMMY/p231/p231_265.wav|p231|Do I think about them often ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_346.wav|p238|His third goal was superb.
DUMMY/p247/p247_330.wav|p247|The party lasted all night.)
DUMMY/p229/p229_272.wav|p229|He was also married with two children.
DUMMY/p231/p231_162.wav|p231|Why change it ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_354.wav|p229|Like his acting, it was an accident.
DUMMY/p248/p248_097.wav|p248|I had a ball today.
DUMMY/p243/p243_172.wav|p243|He said some things which were better left alone.
DUMMY/p249/p249_299.wav|p249|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
DUMMY/p234/p234_095.wav|p234|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p227/p227_008.wav|p227|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p225/p225_040.wav|p225|You'd better believe it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_307.wav|p244|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
DUMMY/p236/p236_425.wav|p236|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
DUMMY/p245/p245_210.wav|p245|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY/p238/p238_231.wav|p238|So I got a blood test.
DUMMY/p239/p239_388.wav|p239|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
DUMMY/p230/p230_299.wav|p230|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p234/p234_077.wav|p234|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY/p225/p225_242.wav|p225|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
DUMMY/p236/p236_084.wav|p236|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
DUMMY/p239/p239_236.wav|p239|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY/p241/p241_264.wav|p241|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY/p249/p249_009.wav|p249|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p227/p227_277.wav|p227|I can't get a job.
DUMMY/p225/p225_258.wav|p225|We were not allowed to go to help them.
DUMMY/p236/p236_283.wav|p236|She always wanted her own way.
DUMMY/p249/p249_143.wav|p249|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
DUMMY/p240/p240_344.wav|p240|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p244/p244_411.wav|p244|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY/p244/p244_311.wav|p244|But it is important for a number of reasons.
DUMMY/p231/p231_276.wav|p231|These figures are truly terrible.
DUMMY/p240/p240_331.wav|p240|Donald was his friend.
DUMMY/p234/p234_109.wav|p234|It is not affected by the sale.
DUMMY/p241/p241_222.wav|p241|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY/p249/p249_119.wav|p249|It was ugly.
DUMMY/p244/p244_048.wav|p244|In fact, they are the future of investment.
DUMMY/p239/p239_345.wav|p239|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY/p241/p241_147.wav|p241|The home side didn't stand a chance.
DUMMY/p237/p237_182.wav|p237|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p237/p237_292.wav|p237|They seem to get away with it.
DUMMY/p241/p241_113.wav|p241|It's not fair.
DUMMY/p238/p238_022.wav|p238|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p246/p246_105.wav|p246|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
DUMMY/p228/p228_167.wav|p228|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
DUMMY/p249/p249_318.wav|p249|The problems began a long time ago.
DUMMY/p231/p231_461.wav|p231|They were good years for him.
DUMMY/p247/p247_477.wav|p247|The casting of her husband was an accident.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_310.wav|p225|What are they for ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_333.wav|p246|Two people were interviewed.
DUMMY/p241/p241_181.wav|p241|It is minute.
DUMMY/p236/p236_236.wav|p236|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY/p246/p246_315.wav|p246|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p229/p229_151.wav|p229|Who would be right ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_209.wav|p227|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
DUMMY/p232/p232_396.wav|p232|I can lead by example.
DUMMY/p250/p250_388.wav|p250|How do you take them away ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_303.wav|p228|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
DUMMY/p237/p237_068.wav|p237|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p244/p244_382.wav|p244|It's fantastic to win again.
DUMMY/p239/p239_241.wav|p239|These days are long gone.
DUMMY/p226/p226_334.wav|p226|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
DUMMY/p246/p246_142.wav|p246|I was awful.
DUMMY/p232/p232_377.wav|p232|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
DUMMY/p240/p240_326.wav|p240|It is out there.
DUMMY/p239/p239_386.wav|p239|Well, that's just a third district.
DUMMY/p226/p226_077.wav|p226|Tommy is not a problem.
DUMMY/p247/p247_271.wav|p247|Did it work ?)
DUMMY/p232/p232_374.wav|p232|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
DUMMY/p238/p238_019.wav|p238|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p239/p239_039.wav|p239|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_224.wav|p228|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
DUMMY/p245/p245_011.wav|p245|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p248/p248_053.wav|p248|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p226/p226_266.wav|p226|The warning is timely.
DUMMY/p236/p236_109.wav|p236|New Year will be very busy.
DUMMY/p240/p240_006.wav|p240|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p225/p225_354.wav|p225|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
DUMMY/p248/p248_152.wav|p248|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
DUMMY/p227/p227_254.wav|p227|It is a court case.
DUMMY/p239/p239_250.wav|p239|I've come here for the jersey.
DUMMY/p244/p244_236.wav|p244|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
DUMMY/p244/p244_337.wav|p244|They have to be addressed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_334.wav|p243|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
DUMMY/p227/p227_074.wav|p227|Even the one she loved.
DUMMY/p231/p231_396.wav|p231|He put some colour into Scottish history.
DUMMY/p250/p250_376.wav|p250|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY/p249/p249_030.wav|p249|There's a story, too.
DUMMY/p226/p226_080.wav|p226|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_320.wav|p243|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
DUMMY/p234/p234_085.wav|p234|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_340.wav|p246|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
DUMMY/p229/p229_249.wav|p229|The letters are going out today.
DUMMY/p240/p240_304.wav|p240|I was the sheep.
DUMMY/p248/p248_253.wav|p248|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY/p244/p244_059.wav|p244|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
DUMMY/p239/p239_095.wav|p239|It was fun, but not a living.
DUMMY/p245/p245_149.wav|p245|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p236/p236_456.wav|p236|They were not even allowed to see them.
DUMMY/p240/p240_206.wav|p240|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY/p247/p247_100.wav|p247|And they had a case.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_201.wav|p243|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
DUMMY/p237/p237_343.wav|p237|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
DUMMY/p226/p226_171.wav|p226|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
DUMMY/p236/p236_013.wav|p236|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p248/p248_172.wav|p248|They thought they had found a home.
DUMMY/p250/p250_328.wav|p250|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
DUMMY/p237/p237_079.wav|p237|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
DUMMY/p229/p229_147.wav|p229|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
DUMMY/p238/p238_120.wav|p238|Are they free ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_412.wav|p247|How do you take them away ?)
DUMMY/p249/p249_289.wav|p249|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
DUMMY/p231/p231_120.wav|p231|There were no grounds for his action.
DUMMY/p245/p245_332.wav|p245|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY/p240/p240_241.wav|p240|Of further privacy, he had no need.
DUMMY/p228/p228_185.wav|p228|I took the gun.
DUMMY/p248/p248_292.wav|p248|I thought it was my only chance.
DUMMY/p225/p225_004.wav|p225|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p245/p245_141.wav|p245|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY/p248/p248_269.wav|p248|Immediate action must be taken.
DUMMY/p244/p244_279.wav|p244|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
DUMMY/p239/p239_421.wav|p239|It makes no difference to their friendship.
DUMMY/p246/p246_060.wav|p246|Scotland had great assets.
DUMMY/p227/p227_135.wav|p227|We could easily have lost that game.
DUMMY/p229/p229_079.wav|p229|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
DUMMY/p239/p239_207.wav|p239|We are now working with full-time on future product.
DUMMY/p227/p227_196.wav|p227|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
DUMMY/p239/p239_191.wav|p239|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
DUMMY/p228/p228_057.wav|p228|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
DUMMY/p238/p238_301.wav|p238|how do you get it back ?
DUMMY/p237/p237_059.wav|p237|We were surprised to see the photograph.
DUMMY/p247/p247_227.wav|p247|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_322.wav|p225|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
DUMMY/p236/p236_047.wav|p236|Everything else is a bonus.
DUMMY/p227/p227_280.wav|p227|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
DUMMY/p236/p236_099.wav|p236|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p229/p229_139.wav|p229|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p225/p225_266.wav|p225|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
DUMMY/p226/p226_092.wav|p226|It's just awful.
DUMMY/p230/p230_276.wav|p230|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
DUMMY/p229/p229_262.wav|p229|They must play for each other.
DUMMY/p245/p245_056.wav|p245|Sadly, it can't.
DUMMY/p236/p236_383.wav|p236|A review is under way.
DUMMY/p225/p225_359.wav|p225|But we welcome this document.
DUMMY/p237/p237_102.wav|p237|But it was a pleasure.
DUMMY/p248/p248_322.wav|p248|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p228/p228_206.wav|p228|They are in the euro.
DUMMY/p227/p227_208.wav|p227|However, it is not as simple as this.
DUMMY/p229/p229_046.wav|p229|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY/p241/p241_277.wav|p241|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY/p244/p244_313.wav|p244|All of the management has invested in the firm.
DUMMY/p237/p237_178.wav|p237|Waiting times for these services are too long.
DUMMY/p229/p229_132.wav|p229|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p238/p238_240.wav|p238|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
DUMMY/p228/p228_157.wav|p228|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
DUMMY/p239/p239_278.wav|p239|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY/p241/p241_162.wav|p241|We have to move forward.
DUMMY/p239/p239_294.wav|p239|I saw them last week.
DUMMY/p226/p226_194.wav|p226|It is a case of taking a risk.
DUMMY/p238/p238_444.wav|p238|I believe we can handle this okay.
DUMMY/p227/p227_048.wav|p227|We have to look beyond the very short term.
DUMMY/p246/p246_048.wav|p246|There is no reason at all.
DUMMY/p229/p229_037.wav|p229|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY/p250/p250_469.wav|p250|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
DUMMY/p245/p245_090.wav|p245|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY/p241/p241_013.wav|p241|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p239/p239_403.wav|p239|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
DUMMY/p226/p226_005.wav|p226|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p229/p229_330.wav|p229|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p246/p246_279.wav|p246|It is so very obvious.
DUMMY/p236/p236_091.wav|p236|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
DUMMY/p229/p229_175.wav|p229|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
DUMMY/p246/p246_170.wav|p246|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
DUMMY/p243/p243_380.wav|p243|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
DUMMY/p245/p245_167.wav|p245|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
DUMMY/p232/p232_315.wav|p232|Kids are terrible.
DUMMY/p248/p248_352.wav|p248|He has seen the past.
DUMMY/p231/p231_113.wav|p231|It proved a good decision.
DUMMY/p241/p241_048.wav|p241|He is too weak to move.
DUMMY/p250/p250_065.wav|p250|This is the first step.
DUMMY/p225/p225_059.wav|p225|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
DUMMY/p245/p245_064.wav|p245|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p243/p243_236.wav|p243|That is the last thing they need.
DUMMY/p240/p240_297.wav|p240|Who did the recruiting?
DUMMY/p231/p231_284.wav|p231|Blair also had a penalty.
DUMMY/p249/p249_125.wav|p249|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p230/p230_341.wav|p230|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
DUMMY/p244/p244_347.wav|p244|But the New Year was special.
DUMMY/p231/p231_133.wav|p231|It is a common problem.
DUMMY/p239/p239_027.wav|p239|And so was a photograph.
DUMMY/p250/p250_185.wav|p250|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p229/p229_319.wav|p229|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p248/p248_202.wav|p248|But she might be.
DUMMY/p229/p229_277.wav|p229|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p237/p237_025.wav|p237|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
DUMMY/p240/p240_245.wav|p240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY/p238/p238_080.wav|p238|We have to keep our clients.
DUMMY/p247/p247_244.wav|p247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_414.wav|p238|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
DUMMY/p247/p247_340.wav|p247|The whole thing is utterly transparent.)
DUMMY/p250/p250_230.wav|p250|My daughter is an adult.
DUMMY/p244/p244_052.wav|p244|The pressure on the players will build.
DUMMY/p246/p246_229.wav|p246|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
DUMMY/p226/p226_004.wav|p226|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY/p230/p230_347.wav|p230|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
DUMMY/p245/p245_028.wav|p245|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
DUMMY/p248/p248_020.wav|p248|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY/p229/p229_055.wav|p229|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY/p240/p240_126.wav|p240|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
DUMMY/p241/p241_374.wav|p241|There is no signature.
DUMMY/p234/p234_113.wav|p234|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
DUMMY/p228/p228_269.wav|p228|He's been here on numerous occasions.
DUMMY/p246/p246_232.wav|p246|Of course I was tempted.
DUMMY/p236/p236_231.wav|p236|The course has helped a lot.
DUMMY/p228/p228_231.wav|p228|He is severe.
DUMMY/p250/p250_473.wav|p250|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
DUMMY/p225/p225_348.wav|p225|Does it matter ?
DUMMY/p248/p248_197.wav|p248|It's the same old story.
DUMMY/p232/p232_106.wav|p232|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
DUMMY/p228/p228_087.wav|p228|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
DUMMY/p226/p226_151.wav|p226|We have seen a copy of the report.
DUMMY/p234/p234_009.wav|p234|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p227/p227_112.wav|p227|It has removed a bit of guilt.
DUMMY/p239/p239_157.wav|p239|Before the game we went for a pint.
DUMMY/p234/p234_316.wav|p234|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
DUMMY/p244/p244_292.wav|p244|I didn't see the point.
DUMMY/p226/p226_305.wav|p226|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p240/p240_076.wav|p240|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY/p225/p225_006.wav|p225|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p246/p246_293.wav|p246|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
DUMMY/p239/p239_340.wav|p239|It will affect their work.
DUMMY/p245/p245_242.wav|p245|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p240/p240_214.wav|p240|It had all been arranged.
DUMMY/p240/p240_366.wav|p240|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
DUMMY/p249/p249_041.wav|p249|Sure, it's funny.
DUMMY/p247/p247_136.wav|p247|This should begin in October.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_097.wav|p245|It was an adventure.
DUMMY/p236/p236_077.wav|p236|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p250/p250_411.wav|p250|We're not taking any risks.
DUMMY/p240/p240_253.wav|p240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
DUMMY/p241/p241_040.wav|p241|President Bush is at war.
DUMMY/p231/p231_121.wav|p231|I was just a child.
DUMMY/p239/p239_079.wav|p239|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
DUMMY/p229/p229_232.wav|p229|Saturday is gone.
DUMMY/p250/p250_242.wav|p250|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
DUMMY/p238/p238_369.wav|p238|The statement contained no surprises.
DUMMY/p243/p243_022.wav|p243|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY/p226/p226_367.wav|p226|Equity declined to comment.
DUMMY/p250/p250_200.wav|p250|We always felt we could win.
DUMMY/p231/p231_360.wav|p231|I've always been a sensitive.
DUMMY/p241/p241_071.wav|p241|He highlighted a lack of staff.
DUMMY/p243/p243_145.wav|p243|All eight victims were based in Germany.
DUMMY/p232/p232_305.wav|p232|They are wrong.
DUMMY/p247/p247_154.wav|p247|how do you get it back ?)
DUMMY/p227/p227_052.wav|p227|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
DUMMY/p237/p237_264.wav|p237|There's the mix.
DUMMY/p225/p225_317.wav|p225|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY/p248/p248_236.wav|p248|It's very safe.
DUMMY/p239/p239_244.wav|p239|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_116.wav|p250|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY/p232/p232_142.wav|p232|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY/p244/p244_282.wav|p244|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
DUMMY/p234/p234_104.wav|p234|She was there for the start of the campaign.
DUMMY/p238/p238_377.wav|p238|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
DUMMY/p229/p229_162.wav|p229|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
DUMMY/p240/p240_086.wav|p240|Someone who cares
DUMMY/p232/p232_380.wav|p232|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
DUMMY/p250/p250_123.wav|p250|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
DUMMY/p229/p229_072.wav|p229|She died in hospital two hours later.
DUMMY/p247/p247_261.wav|p247|Persuaded to change his mind.)
DUMMY/p249/p249_150.wav|p249|It is like a football team.
DUMMY/p249/p249_111.wav|p249|We want to get to the final, anyway.
DUMMY/p246/p246_283.wav|p246|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
DUMMY/p250/p250_316.wav|p250|I wanted to change the formula.
DUMMY/p232/p232_362.wav|p232|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p244/p244_310.wav|p244|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
DUMMY/p247/p247_401.wav|p247|It proved a good decision.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_393.wav|p239|Do I have a favourite ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_014.wav|p230|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p227/p227_070.wav|p227|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY/p226/p226_327.wav|p226|We do the same.
DUMMY/p236/p236_101.wav|p236|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
DUMMY/p246/p246_018.wav|p246|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p232/p232_217.wav|p232|It's not ideal.
DUMMY/p232/p232_086.wav|p232|She had kept the news from him.
DUMMY/p245/p245_006.wav|p245|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p249/p249_223.wav|p249|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
DUMMY/p247/p247_059.wav|p247|So is that it, then ?)
DUMMY/p234/p234_331.wav|p234|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY/p247/p247_082.wav|p247|It happens on an annual basis.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_180.wav|p236|What do they want us to do ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_176.wav|p239|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
DUMMY/p234/p234_021.wav|p234|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p231/p231_039.wav|p231|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
DUMMY/p230/p230_062.wav|p230|Robin Williams is very subdued.
DUMMY/p236/p236_412.wav|p236|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
DUMMY/p234/p234_159.wav|p234|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
DUMMY/p228/p228_049.wav|p228|But it might have done.
DUMMY/p248/p248_119.wav|p248|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
DUMMY/p238/p238_193.wav|p238|The squad is too small.
DUMMY/p247/p247_048.wav|p247|It had little effect on European equity markets.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_308.wav|p241|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
DUMMY/p246/p246_212.wav|p246|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
DUMMY/p239/p239_318.wav|p239|The result is utterly compelling.
DUMMY/p228/p228_271.wav|p228|It's a way of life.
DUMMY/p227/p227_267.wav|p227|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_169.wav|p240|They will do their own thing.
DUMMY/p250/p250_226.wav|p250|Who was she ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_051.wav|p226|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
DUMMY/p226/p226_189.wav|p226|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
DUMMY/p234/p234_291.wav|p234|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY/p239/p239_170.wav|p239|There's still plenty time left.
DUMMY/p239/p239_007.wav|p239|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY/p248/p248_104.wav|p248|That is no use.
DUMMY/p231/p231_442.wav|p231|The people are the hero.
DUMMY/p226/p226_152.wav|p226|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p230/p230_048.wav|p230|It was bound to happen.
DUMMY/p238/p238_314.wav|p238|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
DUMMY/p240/p240_371.wav|p240|That would help.
DUMMY/p234/p234_098.wav|p234|I cannot wait to get started on it.
DUMMY/p250/p250_178.wav|p250|I'd love to be like Peter.
DUMMY/p229/p229_223.wav|p229|I am delighted for Simon.
DUMMY/p226/p226_265.wav|p226|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p243/p243_072.wav|p243|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
DUMMY/p238/p238_335.wav|p238|He was admitted to hospital.
DUMMY/p229/p229_241.wav|p229|We were a load of rubbish.
DUMMY/p247/p247_312.wav|p247|I was there five months ago.)
DUMMY/p247/p247_407.wav|p247|There was an element of frustration.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_405.wav|p236|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
DUMMY/p237/p237_151.wav|p237|The idea is simple.
DUMMY/p229/p229_028.wav|p229|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
DUMMY/p245/p245_047.wav|p245|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p238/p238_087.wav|p238|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p247/p247_069.wav|p247|Only water is currently allowed.)
DUMMY/p227/p227_330.wav|p227|There's still a bit to go.
DUMMY/p241/p241_278.wav|p241|We have to break that cycle.
DUMMY/p243/p243_283.wav|p243|He may be ready for first team action in March.
DUMMY/p228/p228_296.wav|p228|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
DUMMY/p237/p237_266.wav|p237|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
DUMMY/p249/p249_329.wav|p249|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
DUMMY/p239/p239_166.wav|p239|They exist in name alone.
DUMMY/p232/p232_184.wav|p232|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY/p236/p236_313.wav|p236|It was an excellent performance.
DUMMY/p248/p248_185.wav|p248|We did everything by the book.
DUMMY/p236/p236_214.wav|p236|The early physical reports were clear.
DUMMY/p246/p246_224.wav|p246|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
DUMMY/p245/p245_338.wav|p245|Indeed, it was magical.
DUMMY/p236/p236_188.wav|p236|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY/p246/p246_226.wav|p246|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
DUMMY/p227/p227_347.wav|p227|I've got a sense of humour, too.
DUMMY/p250/p250_244.wav|p250|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY/p226/p226_160.wav|p226|They should stop the bombing.
DUMMY/p246/p246_087.wav|p246|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
DUMMY/p240/p240_067.wav|p240|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY/p239/p239_069.wav|p239|He will need that machine.
DUMMY/p249/p249_194.wav|p249|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY/p245/p245_258.wav|p245|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY/p231/p231_066.wav|p231|We will pay their bills.
DUMMY/p238/p238_047.wav|p238|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
DUMMY/p241/p241_137.wav|p241|It was typical.
DUMMY/p236/p236_435.wav|p236|But we have built a platform for next season.
DUMMY/p232/p232_270.wav|p232|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
DUMMY/p247/p247_373.wav|p247|Neither woman has been named.)
DUMMY/p239/p239_392.wav|p239|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p238/p238_337.wav|p238|Abbey National is an option.
DUMMY/p236/p236_369.wav|p236|We are a Scottish company.
DUMMY/p231/p231_392.wav|p231|There was a substantial explosion.
DUMMY/p248/p248_078.wav|p248|Today she has been released.
DUMMY/p247/p247_167.wav|p247|There's always the next century.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_311.wav|p246|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
DUMMY/p240/p240_083.wav|p240|He is in the queue.
DUMMY/p244/p244_190.wav|p244|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
DUMMY/p227/p227_167.wav|p227|Are you going to win ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_322.wav|p228|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
DUMMY/p244/p244_363.wav|p244|At first, the youngster was not keen.
DUMMY/p236/p236_428.wav|p236|I believe the gap is nearly there.
DUMMY/p241/p241_245.wav|p241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
DUMMY/p225/p225_352.wav|p225|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p241/p241_295.wav|p241|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
DUMMY/p230/p230_194.wav|p230|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
DUMMY/p226/p226_046.wav|p226|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
DUMMY/p231/p231_153.wav|p231|He was asked to quit.
DUMMY/p249/p249_149.wav|p249|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
DUMMY/p227/p227_297.wav|p227|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
DUMMY/p239/p239_056.wav|p239|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
DUMMY/p241/p241_258.wav|p241|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
DUMMY/p243/p243_126.wav|p243|So I am going in the right direction.
DUMMY/p250/p250_232.wav|p250|It will affect their work.
DUMMY/p229/p229_003.wav|p229|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p250/p250_210.wav|p250|And we have the experience.
DUMMY/p250/p250_106.wav|p250|We have made no final decisions.
DUMMY/p234/p234_014.wav|p234|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p244/p244_356.wav|p244|However, it does not tell the full story.
DUMMY/p246/p246_284.wav|p246|We are a grandmother.
DUMMY/p231/p231_269.wav|p231|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
DUMMY/p246/p246_299.wav|p246|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
DUMMY/p227/p227_253.wav|p227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
DUMMY/p243/p243_187.wav|p243|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
DUMMY/p228/p228_060.wav|p228|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
DUMMY/p232/p232_193.wav|p232|The procedure is the same in all cases.
DUMMY/p241/p241_138.wav|p241|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
DUMMY/p240/p240_377.wav|p240|He later became a respected High Court judge.
DUMMY/p240/p240_148.wav|p240|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
DUMMY/p250/p250_201.wav|p250|It may have been a cry for help.
DUMMY/p244/p244_280.wav|p244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
DUMMY/p232/p232_283.wav|p232|I am an estate agent.
DUMMY/p241/p241_121.wav|p241|You can spend money on housing.
DUMMY/p229/p229_216.wav|p229|It was worth a photograph.
DUMMY/p240/p240_286.wav|p240|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY/p229/p229_192.wav|p229|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p240/p240_272.wav|p240|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
DUMMY/p244/p244_354.wav|p244|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
DUMMY/p247/p247_081.wav|p247|She died in hospital two hours later.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_070.wav|p226|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
DUMMY/p234/p234_216.wav|p234|It was a management problem in the hospital.
DUMMY/p240/p240_310.wav|p240|We do not expect any surplus.
DUMMY/p234/p234_212.wav|p234|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
DUMMY/p247/p247_030.wav|p247|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_001.wav|p246|Please call Stella.
DUMMY/p225/p225_131.wav|p225|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
DUMMY/p236/p236_080.wav|p236|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p239/p239_284.wav|p239|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
DUMMY/p228/p228_113.wav|p228|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
DUMMY/p238/p238_359.wav|p238|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY/p229/p229_240.wav|p229|We are so proud.
DUMMY/p247/p247_213.wav|p247|Harry Potter has lost his magic.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_326.wav|p226|The airport was even different.
DUMMY/p243/p243_179.wav|p243|Nato has left them with no other option.
DUMMY/p240/p240_303.wav|p240|He said she was mad.
DUMMY/p228/p228_026.wav|p228|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
DUMMY/p245/p245_214.wav|p245|At the time, he was a living legend.
DUMMY/p232/p232_186.wav|p232|It is the whole package.
DUMMY/p236/p236_011.wav|p236|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p243/p243_144.wav|p243|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
DUMMY/p247/p247_423.wav|p247|That's been all around Europe with me.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_255.wav|p234|The world is a good place.
DUMMY/p230/p230_028.wav|p230|Life was like a timetable.
DUMMY/p247/p247_460.wav|p247|The boys are mentally focused.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_277.wav|p243|I think the shares are good value.
DUMMY/p239/p239_134.wav|p239|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
DUMMY/p237/p237_159.wav|p237|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p228/p228_018.wav|p228|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY/p240/p240_362.wav|p240|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY/p241/p241_172.wav|p241|It became a book by itself.
DUMMY/p239/p239_316.wav|p239|I think, therefore I am ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_281.wav|p250|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
DUMMY/p232/p232_060.wav|p232|That is very hard, alone.
DUMMY/p236/p236_224.wav|p236|Which isn't a bad idea.
DUMMY/p232/p232_185.wav|p232|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
DUMMY/p236/p236_276.wav|p236|We accept the new rules.
DUMMY/p226/p226_015.wav|p226|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY/p240/p240_028.wav|p240|Is this accurate?
DUMMY/p248/p248_257.wav|p248|They are real.
DUMMY/p231/p231_171.wav|p231|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
DUMMY/p225/p225_166.wav|p225|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
DUMMY/p240/p240_003.wav|p240|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p247/p247_233.wav|p247|It will be strictly cross-country.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_154.wav|p243|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
DUMMY/p227/p227_340.wav|p227|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
DUMMY/p250/p250_087.wav|p250|They lived for their children.
DUMMY/p228/p228_069.wav|p228|He is a young man with a new deal.
DUMMY/p249/p249_297.wav|p249|What has altered?
DUMMY/p241/p241_059.wav|p241|There was a battle there.
DUMMY/p226/p226_076.wav|p226|Help is needed.
DUMMY/p239/p239_502.wav|p239|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
DUMMY/p249/p249_284.wav|p249|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
DUMMY/p237/p237_080.wav|p237|It may well have been.
DUMMY/p237/p237_277.wav|p237|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
DUMMY/p232/p232_206.wav|p232|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p238/p238_081.wav|p238|We should be able to cope.
DUMMY/p232/p232_342.wav|p232|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
DUMMY/p229/p229_061.wav|p229|Art is extra.
DUMMY/p247/p247_195.wav|p247|It shows the strength of the roots.)
DUMMY/p237/p237_019.wav|p237|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p239/p239_139.wav|p239|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
DUMMY/p228/p228_349.wav|p228|You must have a government and a good civil service.
DUMMY/p231/p231_368.wav|p231|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
DUMMY/p247/p247_295.wav|p247|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_247.wav|p231|Persuaded to change his mind.
DUMMY/p246/p246_098.wav|p246|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
DUMMY/p234/p234_318.wav|p234|The existing structure is in trouble.
DUMMY/p227/p227_056.wav|p227|How are you, sir ?
DUMMY/p240/p240_120.wav|p240|It is a delight on every level.
DUMMY/p243/p243_214.wav|p243|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
DUMMY/p248/p248_268.wav|p248|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
DUMMY/p232/p232_105.wav|p232|That is no use.
DUMMY/p236/p236_202.wav|p236|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
DUMMY/p241/p241_080.wav|p241|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
DUMMY/p237/p237_123.wav|p237|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
DUMMY/p232/p232_132.wav|p232|I am now unemployed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_117.wav|p249|It's a long process.
DUMMY/p237/p237_221.wav|p237|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
DUMMY/p250/p250_052.wav|p250|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
DUMMY/p230/p230_057.wav|p230|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
DUMMY/p246/p246_304.wav|p246|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
DUMMY/p229/p229_377.wav|p229|Talks are progressing.
DUMMY/p229/p229_115.wav|p229|I came to complete.
DUMMY/p244/p244_075.wav|p244|This time, it might be for real.
DUMMY/p238/p238_247.wav|p238|But it couldn't happen overnight.
DUMMY/p248/p248_008.wav|p248|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY/p231/p231_300.wav|p231|But it is up again.
DUMMY/p227/p227_081.wav|p227|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p239/p239_402.wav|p239|I have received no explanation.
DUMMY/p249/p249_087.wav|p249|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
DUMMY/p240/p240_321.wav|p240|We are a peaceful people.
DUMMY/p230/p230_191.wav|p230|We represent a wide range of society.
DUMMY/p250/p250_012.wav|p250|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p229/p229_283.wav|p229|It was a privilege to work for him.
DUMMY/p246/p246_171.wav|p246|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p244/p244_208.wav|p244|It was the story of the second half.
DUMMY/p230/p230_305.wav|p230|You have to see it like this.
DUMMY/p240/p240_285.wav|p240|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
DUMMY/p234/p234_333.wav|p234|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
DUMMY/p238/p238_272.wav|p238|Her political persuasion is no secret.
DUMMY/p226/p226_063.wav|p226|It's a real challenge.
DUMMY/p228/p228_196.wav|p228|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
DUMMY/p247/p247_071.wav|p247|Final proposals will be published in February.)
DUMMY/p250/p250_009.wav|p250|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p229/p229_305.wav|p229|There is no openness.
DUMMY/p247/p247_296.wav|p247|It's hard to see it.)
DUMMY/p238/p238_216.wav|p238|It was started almost by accident.
DUMMY/p248/p248_212.wav|p248|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
DUMMY/p229/p229_116.wav|p229|I was angry.
DUMMY/p231/p231_446.wav|p231|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
DUMMY/p227/p227_134.wav|p227|It is a vicious circle.
DUMMY/p229/p229_090.wav|p229|However, it did not end that way.
DUMMY/p232/p232_323.wav|p232|I came into this world with nothing.
DUMMY/p247/p247_338.wav|p247|It was an achievement all right.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_365.wav|p226|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY/p236/p236_392.wav|p236|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
DUMMY/p236/p236_095.wav|p236|I had a ball today.
DUMMY/p244/p244_159.wav|p244|If not, a deal could take many months.
DUMMY/p240/p240_230.wav|p240|It's so special.
DUMMY/p237/p237_112.wav|p237|Who would be right ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_269.wav|p250|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
DUMMY/p232/p232_192.wav|p232|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
DUMMY/p246/p246_117.wav|p246|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
DUMMY/p229/p229_273.wav|p229|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
DUMMY/p249/p249_236.wav|p249|Broke the birdie record.
DUMMY/p231/p231_439.wav|p231|The British government does not want to know.
DUMMY/p250/p250_479.wav|p250|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
DUMMY/p234/p234_196.wav|p234|Clearly, they had other problems.
DUMMY/p228/p228_149.wav|p228|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
DUMMY/p231/p231_199.wav|p231|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
DUMMY/p238/p238_066.wav|p238|It's the performance we want.
DUMMY/p238/p238_196.wav|p238|Tiger is not the norm.
DUMMY/p237/p237_033.wav|p237|This is the window.
DUMMY/p244/p244_063.wav|p244|He said it was for sale.
DUMMY/p230/p230_152.wav|p230|I'm afraid to say anything.
DUMMY/p240/p240_299.wav|p240|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
DUMMY/p239/p239_133.wav|p239|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_297.wav|p226|There's a pause.
DUMMY/p247/p247_324.wav|p247|I was brought up in a mining background.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_296.wav|p226|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
DUMMY/p247/p247_239.wav|p247|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_146.wav|p246|It is not just about pay.
DUMMY/p226/p226_086.wav|p226|This is the way things should be handled.
DUMMY/p229/p229_351.wav|p229|They may yet have the last laugh.
DUMMY/p248/p248_366.wav|p248|It is legally binding.
DUMMY/p246/p246_078.wav|p246|I first met him last summer.
DUMMY/p230/p230_345.wav|p230|The airport was even different.
DUMMY/p243/p243_108.wav|p243|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
DUMMY/p230/p230_179.wav|p230|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY/p245/p245_194.wav|p245|He knows a lot.
DUMMY/p247/p247_010.wav|p247|People look, but no one ever finds it. )
DUMMY/p231/p231_359.wav|p231|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
DUMMY/p226/p226_089.wav|p226|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p243/p243_120.wav|p243|It is the right package for Scotland.
DUMMY/p247/p247_322.wav|p247|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_131.wav|p236|We will try to find someone.
DUMMY/p238/p238_097.wav|p238|I was very pleased with them today, though.
DUMMY/p229/p229_019.wav|p229|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY/p227/p227_104.wav|p227|And the match was not too bad, either.
DUMMY/p249/p249_054.wav|p249|Next league matches Celtic.
DUMMY/p227/p227_240.wav|p227|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY/p231/p231_453.wav|p231|We put our bid in last night.
DUMMY/p239/p239_216.wav|p239|We had to add value.
DUMMY/p247/p247_083.wav|p247|It is a job creation scheme.)
DUMMY/p245/p245_325.wav|p245|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
DUMMY/p227/p227_042.wav|p227|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
DUMMY/p234/p234_147.wav|p234|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY/p244/p244_062.wav|p244|The company continues to grow.
DUMMY/p240/p240_372.wav|p240|A deadline is still essential.
DUMMY/p238/p238_160.wav|p238|His job was not advertised.
DUMMY/p236/p236_316.wav|p236|These figures are truly awful.
DUMMY/p240/p240_235.wav|p240|And thought we would get away with it.
DUMMY/p250/p250_217.wav|p250|The move follows a review of the Singapore
DUMMY/p225/p225_312.wav|p225|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_311.wav|p226|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
DUMMY/p241/p241_218.wav|p241|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
DUMMY/p226/p226_013.wav|p226|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p249/p249_131.wav|p249|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
DUMMY/p243/p243_063.wav|p243|There were no details of the other five victims.
DUMMY/p234/p234_044.wav|p234|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
DUMMY/p227/p227_337.wav|p227|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p246/p246_200.wav|p246|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
DUMMY/p239/p239_251.wav|p239|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
DUMMY/p228/p228_094.wav|p228|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
DUMMY/p239/p239_471.wav|p239|There's nothing I can say.
DUMMY/p247/p247_117.wav|p247|You had better believe it.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_042.wav|p234|He was in his element.
DUMMY/p229/p229_350.wav|p229|I'm very lucky.
DUMMY/p239/p239_100.wav|p239|Sales are falling after years of growth.
DUMMY/p244/p244_089.wav|p244|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
DUMMY/p230/p230_337.wav|p230|Do you think we are a top nation ?
DUMMY/p227/p227_333.wav|p227|It is so easy to be negative.
DUMMY/p236/p236_181.wav|p236|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_330.wav|p249|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
DUMMY/p240/p240_183.wav|p240|Miller was every bit as happy.
DUMMY/p249/p249_300.wav|p249|Our task is to complete the picture.
DUMMY/p239/p239_425.wav|p239|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
DUMMY/p227/p227_374.wav|p227|It has been made to entertain.
DUMMY/p250/p250_234.wav|p250|I am considered a teenager.
DUMMY/p238/p238_077.wav|p238|I have made that offer.
DUMMY/p240/p240_066.wav|p240|They are real.
DUMMY/p228/p228_104.wav|p228|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
DUMMY/p234/p234_351.wav|p234|His concern is only for the future.
DUMMY/p228/p228_337.wav|p228|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
DUMMY/p232/p232_292.wav|p232|The attacker died in the crash.
DUMMY/p226/p226_197.wav|p226|There was no option.
DUMMY/p236/p236_341.wav|p236|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY/p237/p237_335.wav|p237|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY/p230/p230_211.wav|p230|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
DUMMY/p228/p228_178.wav|p228|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
DUMMY/p240/p240_365.wav|p240|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
DUMMY/p243/p243_352.wav|p243|Sales will begin by the end of October.
DUMMY/p234/p234_065.wav|p234|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
DUMMY/p232/p232_176.wav|p232|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
DUMMY/p229/p229_290.wav|p229|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
DUMMY/p244/p244_301.wav|p244|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
DUMMY/p247/p247_107.wav|p247|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_261.wav|p234|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
DUMMY/p244/p244_273.wav|p244|I am still waiting for a reply.
DUMMY/p245/p245_188.wav|p245|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY/p232/p232_107.wav|p232|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
DUMMY/p228/p228_035.wav|p228|It was clear.
DUMMY/p234/p234_332.wav|p234|But it can be done.
DUMMY/p250/p250_047.wav|p250|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p230/p230_304.wav|p230|I was there five months ago.
DUMMY/p226/p226_003.wav|p226|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p238/p238_379.wav|p238|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
DUMMY/p231/p231_262.wav|p231|And they were being paid ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_430.wav|p247|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.)
DUMMY/p234/p234_071.wav|p234|She did that for the rest of her life.
DUMMY/p243/p243_077.wav|p243|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
DUMMY/p236/p236_104.wav|p236|It is a total and utter change of culture.
DUMMY/p228/p228_052.wav|p228|He looks like an Afghan.
DUMMY/p228/p228_142.wav|p228|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY/p227/p227_163.wav|p227|Nobody did in those days.
DUMMY/p229/p229_181.wav|p229|Does that put pressure on us ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_341.wav|p239|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
DUMMY/p244/p244_038.wav|p244|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
DUMMY/p243/p243_262.wav|p243|There would be a north and south division.
DUMMY/p238/p238_207.wav|p238|There was a fine line to tread.
DUMMY/p239/p239_021.wav|p239|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p239/p239_335.wav|p239|From there, they can go anywhere.
DUMMY/p227/p227_076.wav|p227|There may be reasons for it.
DUMMY/p244/p244_203.wav|p244|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
DUMMY/p247/p247_125.wav|p247|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.)
DUMMY/p225/p225_192.wav|p225|However, this idea is never developed.
DUMMY/p243/p243_160.wav|p243|A progress report will be published in October.
DUMMY/p228/p228_023.wav|p228|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY/p227/p227_057.wav|p227|So is that it, then ?
DUMMY/p231/p231_034.wav|p231|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY/p228/p228_347.wav|p228|She is free.
DUMMY/p234/p234_066.wav|p234|He has not been dropped.
DUMMY/p234/p234_288.wav|p234|What form did that take ?
DUMMY/p239/p239_142.wav|p239|Absences should be carefully monitored.
DUMMY/p248/p248_113.wav|p248|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
DUMMY/p250/p250_304.wav|p250|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
DUMMY/p250/p250_323.wav|p250|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
DUMMY/p246/p246_107.wav|p246|Is that right?
DUMMY/p229/p229_121.wav|p229|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY/p230/p230_205.wav|p230|He had suffered a heart attack.
DUMMY/p247/p247_282.wav|p247|There were no problems with the crowds.)
DUMMY/p236/p236_038.wav|p236|That means an extra two years.
DUMMY/p239/p239_352.wav|p239|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
DUMMY/p239/p239_263.wav|p239|Our position remains the same.
DUMMY/p246/p246_173.wav|p246|I drove the ball well.
DUMMY/p239/p239_108.wav|p239|He was a lovely man.
DUMMY/p241/p241_317.wav|p241|It is out there.
DUMMY/p231/p231_106.wav|p231|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_021.wav|p249|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY/p246/p246_303.wav|p246|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
DUMMY/p247/p247_155.wav|p247|That is the ultimate revenge.)
DUMMY/p248/p248_351.wav|p248|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
DUMMY/p243/p243_095.wav|p243|He will be a very hard act to follow.
DUMMY/p231/p231_213.wav|p231|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p232/p232_043.wav|p232|But it took a lot of bottle.
DUMMY/p229/p229_221.wav|p229|She should not be blamed.
DUMMY/p225/p225_171.wav|p225|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
DUMMY/p246/p246_359.wav|p246|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
DUMMY/p227/p227_172.wav|p227|One season, they might do well.
DUMMY/p240/p240_154.wav|p240|I was in daily contact.
DUMMY/p237/p237_138.wav|p237|They took a risk.
DUMMY/p244/p244_226.wav|p244|I was not overly concerned about this.
DUMMY/p237/p237_160.wav|p237|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
DUMMY/p247/p247_418.wav|p247|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.)
DUMMY/p231/p231_280.wav|p231|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
DUMMY/p244/p244_409.wav|p244|They are not going the length of the pitch.
DUMMY/p234/p234_160.wav|p234|There is no common ground.
DUMMY/p232/p232_249.wav|p232|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
DUMMY/p239/p239_063.wav|p239|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
DUMMY/p226/p226_163.wav|p226|I've learned from my mistakes.
DUMMY/p229/p229_355.wav|p229|It is long gone.
DUMMY/p250/p250_131.wav|p250|He thought she was amazing.
DUMMY/p228/p228_227.wav|p228|Clearly, the stakes are high.
DUMMY/p226/p226_350.wav|p226|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
DUMMY/p232/p232_091.wav|p232|It is a lifeline.
DUMMY/p243/p243_049.wav|p243|Has the conflict started ?
DUMMY/p229/p229_391.wav|p229|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
DUMMY/p238/p238_056.wav|p238|After the match, do you ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_099.wav|p228|It is annoying.
DUMMY/p240/p240_263.wav|p240|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY/p231/p231_011.wav|p231|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY/p236/p236_152.wav|p236|It would seem a natural progression.
DUMMY/p227/p227_382.wav|p227|This will impact on us.
DUMMY/p231/p231_164.wav|p231|He was in great spirits.
DUMMY/p229/p229_054.wav|p229|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
DUMMY/p230/p230_092.wav|p230|He was prepared for this.
DUMMY/p243/p243_324.wav|p243|It is not either national standards or local control.
DUMMY/p239/p239_012.wav|p239|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY/p250/p250_026.wav|p250|Meetings will also remain private.
DUMMY/p236/p236_161.wav|p236|It is not a financial issue.
DUMMY/p238/p238_437.wav|p238|We are aiming for early March.
DUMMY/p229/p229_334.wav|p229|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
DUMMY/p225/p225_005.wav|p225|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p250/p250_481.wav|p250|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY/p229/p229_025.wav|p229|Johnson was pretty low.
DUMMY/p249/p249_326.wav|p249|It could have gone either way.
DUMMY/p238/p238_330.wav|p238|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
DUMMY/p231/p231_333.wav|p231|However, the groups denied the claims.
DUMMY/p237/p237_262.wav|p237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
DUMMY/p250/p250_067.wav|p250|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
DUMMY/p230/p230_311.wav|p230|And we can do it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_125.wav|p248|She does not want to speak.
DUMMY/p247/p247_207.wav|p247|It gave no further details.)
DUMMY/p243/p243_211.wav|p243|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
DUMMY/p229/p229_009.wav|p229|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p240/p240_370.wav|p240|Hartley should know.
DUMMY/p240/p240_049.wav|p240|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p238/p238_183.wav|p238|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
DUMMY/p230/p230_159.wav|p230|So what is the campaign about ?
DUMMY/p226/p226_062.wav|p226|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
DUMMY/p230/p230_221.wav|p230|What do we want to do that for ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_359.wav|p250|Is our children learning ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_028.wav|p232|They should be so lucky.
DUMMY/p231/p231_240.wav|p231|It is now the big brother.
DUMMY/p236/p236_271.wav|p236|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
DUMMY/p249/p249_324.wav|p249|I am so upset.
DUMMY/p238/p238_249.wav|p238|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
DUMMY/p249/p249_045.wav|p249|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY/p225/p225_297.wav|p225|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
DUMMY/p227/p227_205.wav|p227|They have the cash and the fire power.
DUMMY/p232/p232_082.wav|p232|What has changed ?
DUMMY/p250/p250_205.wav|p250|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
DUMMY/p241/p241_208.wav|p241|I don't want to use it.
DUMMY/p231/p231_054.wav|p231|She said she was really sorry.
DUMMY/p249/p249_220.wav|p249|Feel the heat?
DUMMY/p250/p250_275.wav|p250|I got a yellow card.
DUMMY/p239/p239_362.wav|p239|Walker plans to return indoors.
DUMMY/p232/p232_084.wav|p232|I will miss him.
DUMMY/p227/p227_087.wav|p227|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
DUMMY/p246/p246_257.wav|p246|I could have got out a long time ago.
DUMMY/p249/p249_338.wav|p249|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
DUMMY/p241/p241_074.wav|p241|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
DUMMY/p232/p232_276.wav|p232|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
DUMMY/p243/p243_345.wav|p243|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
DUMMY/p231/p231_217.wav|p231|He has a lot of skill.
DUMMY/p245/p245_231.wav|p245|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
DUMMY/p232/p232_409.wav|p232|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
DUMMY/p234/p234_119.wav|p234|No, the equipment is extra.
DUMMY/p248/p248_085.wav|p248|By then, he was walking on water.
DUMMY/p232/p232_068.wav|p232|It is like a river running by my home.
DUMMY/p226/p226_214.wav|p226|I'm pleased about one thing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_384.wav|p244|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
DUMMY/p245/p245_146.wav|p245|I was in the train station overnight.
DUMMY/p248/p248_038.wav|p248|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
DUMMY/p244/p244_360.wav|p244|It was a test in itself.
DUMMY/p239/p239_380.wav|p239|Pensions are a long-term investment.
DUMMY/p228/p228_248.wav|p228|It was a hit.
DUMMY/p236/p236_326.wav|p236|This is a historic occasion.
DUMMY/p245/p245_345.wav|p245|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p248/p248_156.wav|p248|That includes the equipment?
DUMMY/p249/p249_327.wav|p249|He was then replaced by Ross.
DUMMY/p229/p229_098.wav|p229|She's got to say something.
DUMMY/p234/p234_037.wav|p234|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
DUMMY/p241/p241_200.wav|p241|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
DUMMY/p236/p236_366.wav|p236|It's as wide as a church in here.
DUMMY/p231/p231_438.wav|p231|They are not left wing.
DUMMY/p244/p244_246.wav|p244|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_440.wav|p247|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.)
DUMMY/p246/p246_067.wav|p246|There could be a way back.
DUMMY/p248/p248_211.wav|p248|He is slightly confused.
DUMMY/p229/p229_101.wav|p229|She has so much to offer.
DUMMY/p231/p231_441.wav|p231|We shall not forget him.
DUMMY/p236/p236_355.wav|p236|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
DUMMY/p232/p232_401.wav|p232|It is legally binding.
DUMMY/p244/p244_413.wav|p244|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY/p243/p243_159.wav|p243|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
DUMMY/p238/p238_455.wav|p238|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
DUMMY/p230/p230_296.wav|p230|It took a month and a half to film.
DUMMY/p227/p227_395.wav|p227|I felt the head was very like me.
DUMMY/p238/p238_424.wav|p238|Got to get my sunglasses.
DUMMY/p241/p241_326.wav|p241|We agreed to disagree.
DUMMY/p250/p250_143.wav|p250|My life has changed a lot.
DUMMY/p227/p227_257.wav|p227|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
DUMMY/p238/p238_014.wav|p238|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY/p244/p244_209.wav|p244|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY/p239/p239_429.wav|p239|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
DUMMY/p248/p248_362.wav|p248|Now, though, he has an incentive.
DUMMY/p227/p227_301.wav|p227|It's hard to see it.
DUMMY/p227/p227_166.wav|p227|What happened in that game ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_065.wav|p228|It's that kind of place.
DUMMY/p245/p245_042.wav|p245|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
DUMMY/p231/p231_045.wav|p231|I guess I was lucky, though.
DUMMY/p236/p236_267.wav|p236|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
DUMMY/p225/p225_244.wav|p225|What was the matter for concern ?
DUMMY/p228/p228_362.wav|p228|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
DUMMY/p245/p245_124.wav|p245|He was in a great deal of pain.
DUMMY/p243/p243_113.wav|p243|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p247/p247_428.wav|p247|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.)
DUMMY/p244/p244_408.wav|p244|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
DUMMY/p247/p247_073.wav|p247|Robin Williams is very subdued.)
DUMMY/p226/p226_310.wav|p226|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
DUMMY/p231/p231_295.wav|p231|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p229/p229_125.wav|p229|It is rubbish.
DUMMY/p248/p248_192.wav|p248|All options are open.
DUMMY/p247/p247_349.wav|p247|What do they want us to do ?)
DUMMY/p231/p231_361.wav|p231|Glasgow is a friendly city.
DUMMY/p239/p239_266.wav|p239|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY/p237/p237_202.wav|p237|Our strategy is straightforward.
DUMMY/p236/p236_403.wav|p236|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
DUMMY/p241/p241_037.wav|p241|It's nice to hear.
DUMMY/p226/p226_219.wav|p226|I might come back.
DUMMY/p249/p249_182.wav|p249|The jury is still out.
DUMMY/p231/p231_046.wav|p231|I was inspired by two things.
DUMMY/p249/p249_315.wav|p249|They were fantastic.
DUMMY/p234/p234_185.wav|p234|He called for a public inquiry.
DUMMY/p249/p249_003.wav|p249|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY/p229/p229_298.wav|p229|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
DUMMY/p245/p245_243.wav|p245|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
DUMMY/p249/p249_115.wav|p249|You had better believe it.
DUMMY/p248/p248_143.wav|p248|It's a crucial award.
DUMMY/p243/p243_009.wav|p243|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p234/p234_062.wav|p234|That is all in the past.
DUMMY/p226/p226_045.wav|p226|This represents a tough game for us.
DUMMY/p249/p249_128.wav|p249|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
DUMMY/p227/p227_176.wav|p227|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY/p230/p230_289.wav|p230|In that moment, I was happy.
DUMMY/p240/p240_009.wav|p240|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY/p236/p236_176.wav|p236|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY/p245/p245_190.wav|p245|Now, it's all right.
DUMMY/p230/p230_121.wav|p230|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY/p225/p225_268.wav|p225|I realised I was lucky to have it.
DUMMY/p234/p234_188.wav|p234|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
DUMMY/p245/p245_076.wav|p245|I'd like to continue that record.
DUMMY/p234/p234_265.wav|p234|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
DUMMY/p250/p250_211.wav|p250|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
DUMMY/p244/p244_403.wav|p244|He is a quality player.
DUMMY/p243/p243_013.wav|p243|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY/p249/p249_240.wav|p249|It's a lovely, lovely film.
DUMMY/p229/p229_315.wav|p229|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
DUMMY/p230/p230_210.wav|p230|We have an election in eight days.
DUMMY/p239/p239_104.wav|p239|I am so proud of him.
DUMMY/p226/p226_006.wav|p226|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY/p226/p226_148.wav|p226|Three penalties were given.
DUMMY/p239/p239_474.wav|p239|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
DUMMY/p238/p238_034.wav|p238|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
DUMMY/p228/p228_086.wav|p228|Nothing is yet confirmed.
DUMMY/p249/p249_157.wav|p249|It is not normal practice.
DUMMY/p247/p247_092.wav|p247|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.)
DUMMY/p230/p230_386.wav|p230|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
DUMMY/p245/p245_034.wav|p245|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
DUMMY/p239/p239_360.wav|p239|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
DUMMY/p248/p248_237.wav|p248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
DUMMY/p247/p247_062.wav|p247|Why do it otherwise ?)
DUMMY/p244/p244_285.wav|p244|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
DUMMY/p245/p245_204.wav|p245|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
DUMMY/p246/p246_176.wav|p246|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
DUMMY/p232/p232_334.wav|p232|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
DUMMY/p225/p225_277.wav|p225|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY/p231/p231_225.wav|p231|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
DUMMY/p231/p231_005.wav|p231|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY/p230/p230_290.wav|p230|The actor has met with Mandela.
DUMMY/p228/p228_042.wav|p228|No meaningful response was issued.
DUMMY/p234/p234_326.wav|p234|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
DUMMY/p249/p249_270.wav|p249|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
DUMMY/p240/p240_247.wav|p240|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
DUMMY/p240/p240_185.wav|p240|We want to help them through it.
DUMMY/p247/p247_120.wav|p247|There's still plenty time left.)
DUMMY/p241/p241_161.wav|p241|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
